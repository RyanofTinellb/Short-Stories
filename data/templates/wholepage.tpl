- "<h2>Detsora\u2019s Diary</h2><main-contents>"
- <p>The classroom was quiet, the only sound the scratching of styli across slate
  and the soft sussurus of cloth as the teacher circulated the room.</p>
- "<p>A shadow appeared above Detsora\u2019s work, followed by a finger seemingly\
  \ from the sky.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is this scribble here?\u201D said the owner of the finger.</p>"
- "<p>The student looked up at her teacher, confused. \u201CIt\u2019s my name. Detsora.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat cannot be your name. We do not accept made\u2011up names here. Your\
  \ name is here, on your nameplate.\u201D A tap on the plaque set just above her\
  \ desk. \u201CDatirra. A lovely name. You should be proud of it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, sensei.\u201D With some difficulty, Detsora copied the plaque onto\
  \ her slate. She was still learning script, and yet she was always expected to keep\
  \ up. She continued with her interrupted exercise as the teacher nodded in approval\
  \ and moved on.</p>"
- "<p>It was the first day of the week. Detsora couldn\u2019t completely follow the\
  \ text she was copying. But it <em>was</em> the first day of the week, so she knew\
  \ what it had to be:</p>"
- "<p><em>\u201CI swear to follow the Queen, who shares the glory of Caemi with the\
  \ world.\u201D</em></p>"
- "<p>Caemi, the lightbringer, the name given to the divine force of the Sun when\
  \ high in the sky. Her father had taught her to honour the Lord of the Hunt and\
  \ the Lady of the Hearth, but these cthonic deities were gone now, along with her\
  \ father. The new teaching was that the Divine Parents had only ever been stories.\
  \ Maybe that\u2019s all her father had been, also.</p>"
- "<p><em>\u201CI swear to bring value to my country, raising weapons in war and lowering\
  \ them in peace.\u201D</em></p>"
- <p>Her sister and brother had begun teaching her to fight, to protect herself. She
  had longed to grow up and join the Defence alongside her elder siblings, but that
  was no longer possible. Defence had fallen. They had let go of their weapons in
  wartime, and there was no one left to pick them up again.</p>
- "<p><em>\u201CI swear to uphold the traditions of this town, and to assist the administrators\
  \ whenever I am required.\u201D</em></p>"
- "<p>Just a few years ago, her grandparents had taken her to the annual harvest bonfire\
  \ festival. Being related to the mayor had its advantages. Detsora had been the\
  \ first one that year to be allowed to place her wishing scroll among the flames.\
  \ The embers had risen to join the newly visible stars as dusk fell, carrying her\
  \ wish with them. It had come true, too, although she was never quite able to believe\
  \ it. If she\u2019d known what was to happen, though, she wouldn\u2019t have wasted\
  \ that wish. Her grandparents were displayed for two whole days,  so that the townspeople\
  \ would know the penalty for defying the invaders.</p>"
- "<p><em>\u201CI swear to remain true as a citizen of this town, this country, this\
  \ world.\u201D</em></p>"
- "<p>Remain true. As easy as that. Remain true to what, though? Her mother had taught\
  \ her about remaining true. She recalled the unshed tears in her mother\u2019s eyes\
  \ as she was taken away from their home and brought to this school. Her mother had\
  \ remained true to the lost ways and the lost people, and had been lost, too. Remain\
  \ true\u2026</p>"
- "<p>\u2026to herself. She was the only one left, now. Who else was there to be true\
  \ to? With a single motion, she erased her slate and began again. With shaking hands,\
  \ she formed the glyphs for her <em>real</em> name, D\u2011E\u2011T\u2011S\u2011\
  O\u2011R\u2011A.</p></main-contents><p></p>"

  </p>"
- "<p>Such were the loud and startling words which resounded through the air, above\
  \ the vast watery desert of the Pacific, about four o\u2019clock in the evening\
  \ of the 23rd of March, 1865.</p>"
- "<p>Few can possibly have forgotten the terrible storm from the northeast, in the\
  \ middle of the equinox of that year. The tempest raged without intermission from\
  \ the 18th to the 26th of March. Its ravages were terrible in America, Europe, and\
  \ Asia, covering a distance of eighteen hundred miles, and extending obliquely to\
  \ the equator from the thirty\u2011fifth north parallel to the fortieth south parallel.\
  \ Towns were overthrown, forests uprooted, coasts devastated by the mountains of\
  \ water which were precipitated on them, vessels cast on the shore, which the published\
  \ accounts numbered by hundreds, whole districts leveled by waterspouts which destroyed\
  \ everything they passed over, several thousand people crushed on land or drowned\
  \ at sea; such were the traces of its fury, left by this devastating tempest. It\
  \ surpassed in disasters those which so frightfully ravaged Havana and Guadalupe,\
  \ one on the 25th of October, 1810, the other on the 26th of July, 1825.</p>"
- <p>But while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at sea, a drama
  not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated air.</p>
- <p>In fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of a waterspout,
  had been taken into the circling movement of a column of air and had traversed space
  at the rate of ninety miles an hour, turning round and round as if seized by some
  aerial maelstrom.</p>
- <p>Beneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing five passengers,
  scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor mingled with spray which hung over
  the surface of the ocean.</p>
- "<p>Whence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest? From what part\
  \ of the world did it rise? It surely could not have started during the storm. But\
  \ the storm had raged five days already, and the first symptoms were manifested\
  \ on the 18th. It cannot be doubted that the balloon came from a great distance,\
  \ for it could not have traveled less than two thousand miles in twenty\u2011four\
  \ hours.</p>"
- <p>At any rate the passengers, destitute of all marks for their guidance, could
  not have possessed the means of reckoning the route traversed since their departure.
  It was a remarkable fact that, although in the very midst of the furious tempest,
  they did not suffer from it. They were thrown about and whirled round and round
  without feeling the rotation in the slightest degree, or being sensible that they
  were removed from a horizontal position.</p>
- <p>Their eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered beneath
  the car. Dark vapor was all around them. Such was the density of the atmosphere
  that they could not be certain whether it was day or night. No reflection of light,
  no sound from inhabited land, no roaring of the ocean could have reached them, through
  the obscurity, while suspended in those elevated zones. Their rapid descent alone
  had informed them of the dangers which they ran from the waves. However, the balloon,
  lightened of heavy articles, such as ammunition, arms, and provisions, had risen
  into the higher layers of the atmosphere, to a height of 4,500 feet. The voyagers,
  after having discovered that the sea extended beneath them, and thinking the dangers
  above less dreadful than those below, did not hesitate to throw overboard even their
  most useful articles, while they endeavored to lose no more of that fluid, the life
  of their enterprise, which sustained them above the abyss.</p>
- "<p>The night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been death to less\
  \ energetic souls. Again the day appeared and with it the tempest began to moderate.\
  \ From the beginning of that day, the 24th of March, it showed symptoms of abating.\
  \ At dawn, some of the lighter clouds had risen into the more lofty regions of the\
  \ air. In a few hours the wind had changed from a hurricane to a fresh breeze, that\
  \ is to say, the rate of the transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by\
  \ half. It was still what sailors call \u201Ca close\u2011reefed topsail breeze,\u201D\
  \ but the commotion in the elements had none the less considerably diminished.</p>"
- "<p>Towards eleven o\u2019clock, the lower region of the air was sensibly clearer.\
  \ The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is felt after the passage\
  \ of a great meteor. The storm did not seem to have gone farther to the west. It\
  \ appeared to have exhausted itself. Could it have passed away in electric sheets,\
  \ as is sometimes the case with regard to the typhoons of the Indian Ocean?</p>"
- <p>But at the same time, it was also evident that the balloon was again slowly descending
  with a regular movement. It appeared as if it were, little by little, collapsing,
  and that its case was lengthening and extending, passing from a spherical to an
  oval form. Towards midday the balloon was hovering above the sea at a height of
  only 2,000 feet. It contained 50,000 cubic feet of gas, and, thanks to its capacity,
  it could maintain itself a long time in the air, although it should reach a great
  altitude or might be thrown into a horizontal position.</p>
- "<p>Perceiving their danger, the passengers cast away the last articles which still\
  \ weighed down the car, the few provisions they had kept, everything, even to their\
  \ pocket\u2011knives, and one of them, having hoisted himself on to the circles\
  \ which united the cords of the net, tried to secure more firmly the lower point\
  \ of the balloon.</p>"
- <p>It was, however, evident to the voyagers that the gas was failing, and that the
  balloon could no longer be sustained in the higher regions. They must infallibly
  perish!</p>
- <p>There was not a continent, nor even an island, visible beneath them. The watery
  expanse did not present a single speck of land, not a solid surface upon which their
  anchor could hold.</p>
- <p>It was the open sea, whose waves were still dashing with tremendous violence!
  It was the ocean, without any visible limits, even for those whose gaze, from their
  commanding position, extended over a radius of forty miles. The vast liquid plain,
  lashed without mercy by the storm, appeared as if covered with herds of furious
  chargers, whose white and disheveled crests were streaming in the wind. No land
  was in sight, not a solitary ship could be seen. It was necessary at any cost to
  arrest their downward course, and to prevent the balloon from being engulfed in
  the waves. The voyagers directed all their energies to this urgent work. But, notwithstanding
  their efforts, the balloon still fell, and at the same time shifted with the greatest
  rapidity, following the direction of the wind, that is to say, from the northeast
  to the southwest.</p>
- <p>Frightful indeed was the situation of these unfortunate men. They were evidently
  no longer masters of the machine. All their attempts were useless. The case of the
  balloon collapsed more and more. The gas escaped without any possibility of retaining
  it. Their descent was visibly accelerated, and soon after midday the car hung within
  600 feet of the ocean.</p>
- <p>It was impossible to prevent the escape of gas, which rushed through a large
  rent in the silk. By lightening the car of all the articles which it contained,
  the passengers had been able to prolong their suspension in the air for a few hours.
  But the inevitable catastrophe could only be retarded, and if land did not appear
  before night, voyagers, car, and balloon must to a certainty vanish beneath the
  waves.</p>
- <p>They now resorted to the only remaining expedient. They were truly dauntless
  men, who knew how to look death in the face. Not a single murmur escaped from their
  lips. They were determined to struggle to the last minute, to do anything to retard
  their fall. The car was only a sort of willow basket, unable to float, and there
  was not the slightest possibility of maintaining it on the surface of the sea.</p>
- <p>Two more hours passed and the balloon was scarcely 400 feet above the water.</p>
- "<p>At that moment a loud voice, the voice of a man whose heart was inaccessible\
  \ to fear, was heard. To this voice responded others not less determined. \u201C\
  Is everything thrown out?\u201D \u201CNo, here are still 2,000 dollars in gold.\u201D\
  \ A heavy bag immediately plunged into the sea. \u201CDoes the balloon rise?\u201D\
  \ \u201CA little, but it will not be long before it falls again.\u201D \u201CWhat\
  \ still remains to be thrown out?\u201D \u201CNothing.\u201D \u201CYes! the car!\u201D\
  \ \u201CLet us catch hold of the net, and into the sea with the car.\u201D</p>"
- <p>This was, in fact, the last and only mode of lightening the balloon. The ropes
  which held the car were cut, and the balloon, after its fall, mounted 2,000 feet.
  The five voyagers had hoisted themselves into the net, and clung to the meshes,
  gazing at the abyss.</p>
- <p>The delicate sensibility of balloons is well known. It is sufficient to throw
  out the lightest article to produce a difference in its vertical position. The apparatus
  in the air is like a balance of mathematical precision. It can be thus easily understood
  that when it is lightened of any considerable weight its movement will be impetuous
  and sudden. So it happened on this occasion. But after being suspended for an instant
  aloft, the balloon began to redescend, the gas escaping by the rent which it was
  impossible to repair.</p>
- <p>The men had done all that men could do. No human efforts could save them now.</p>
- <p>They must trust to the mercy of Him who rules the elements.</p>
- "<p>At four o\u2019clock the balloon was only 500 feet above the surface of the\
  \ water.</p>"
- <p>A loud barking was heard. A dog accompanied the voyagers, and was held pressed
  close to his master in the meshes of the net.</p>
- "<p>\u201CTop has seen something,\u201D cried one of the men. Then immediately a\
  \ loud voice shouted,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLand! land!\u201D The balloon, which the wind still drove towards the\
  \ southwest, had since daybreak gone a considerable distance, which might be reckoned\
  \ by hundreds of miles, and a tolerably high land had, in fact, appeared in that\
  \ direction. But this land was still thirty miles off. It would not take less than\
  \ an hour to get to it, and then there was the chance of falling to leeward.</p>"
- <p>An hour! Might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the fluid it yet
  retained?</p>
- <p>Such was the terrible question! The voyagers could distinctly see that solid
  spot which they must reach at any cost. They were ignorant of what it was, whether
  an island or a continent, for they did not know to what part of the world the hurricane
  had driven them. But they must reach this land, whether inhabited or desolate, whether
  hospitable or not.</p>
- "<p>It was evident that the balloon could no longer support itself! Several times\
  \ already had the crests of the enormous billows licked the bottom of the net, making\
  \ it still heavier, and the balloon only half rose, like a bird with a wounded wing.\
  \ Half an hour later the land was not more than a mile off, but the balloon, exhausted,\
  \ flabby, hanging in great folds, had gas in its upper part alone. The voyagers,\
  \ clinging to the net, were still too heavy for it, and soon, half plunged into\
  \ the sea, they were beaten by the furious waves. The balloon\u2011case bulged out\
  \ again, and the wind, taking it, drove it along like a vessel. Might it not possibly\
  \ thus reach the land?</p>"
- <p>But, when only two fathoms off, terrible cries resounded from four pairs of lungs
  at once. The balloon, which had appeared as if it would never again rise, suddenly
  made an unexpected bound, after having been struck by a tremendous sea. As if it
  had been at that instant relieved of a new part of its weight, it mounted to a height
  of 1,500 feet, and here it met a current of wind, which instead of taking it directly
  to the coast, carried it in a nearly parallel direction.</p>
- <p>At last, two minutes later, it reproached obliquely, and finally fell on a sandy
  beach, out of the reach of the waves.</p>
- <p>The voyagers, aiding each other, managed to disengage themselves from the meshes
  of the net. The balloon, relieved of their weight, was taken by the wind, and like
  a wounded bird which revives for an instant, disappeared into space.</p>
- <p>But the car had contained five passengers, with a dog, and the balloon only left
  four on the shore.</p>
- "<p>The missing person had evidently been swept off by the sea, which had just struck\
  \ the net, and it was owing to this circumstance that the lightened balloon rose\
  \ the last time, and then soon after reached the land. Scarcely had the four castaways\
  \ set foot on firm ground, than they all, thinking of the absent one, simultaneously\
  \ exclaimed, \u201CPerhaps he will try to swim to land! Let us save him! let us\
  \ save him!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 2</p>
- <p>Those whom the hurricane had just thrown on this coast were neither aeronauts
  by profession nor amateurs. They were prisoners of war whose boldness had induced
  them to escape in this extraordinary manner.</p>
- <p>A hundred times they had almost perished! A hundred times had they almost fallen
  from their torn balloon into the depths of the ocean. But Heaven had reserved them
  for a strange destiny, and after having, on the 20th of March, escaped from Richmond,
  besieged by the troops of General Ulysses Grant, they found themselves seven thousand
  miles from the capital of Virginia, which was the principal stronghold of the South,
  during the terrible War of Secession. Their aerial voyage had lasted five days.</p>
- <p>The curious circumstances which led to the escape of the prisoners were as follows:</p>
- "<p>That same year, in the month of February, 1865, in one of the coups de main\
  \ by which General Grant attempted, though in vain, to possess himself of Richmond,\
  \ several of his officers fell into the power of the enemy and were detained in\
  \ the town. One of the most distinguished was Captain Cyrus Harding. He was a native\
  \ of Massachusetts, a first\u2011class engineer, to whom the government had confided,\
  \ during the war, the direction of the railways, which were so important at that\
  \ time. A true Northerner, thin, bony, lean, about forty\u2011five years of age;\
  \ his close\u2011cut hair and his beard, of which he only kept a thick mustache,\
  \ were already getting gray. He had one\u2011of those finely\u2011developed heads\
  \ which appear made to be struck on a medal, piercing eyes, a serious mouth, the\
  \ physiognomy of a clever man of the military school. He was one of those engineers\
  \ who began by handling the hammer and pickaxe, like generals who first act as common\
  \ soldiers. Besides mental power, he also possessed great manual dexterity. His\
  \ muscles exhibited remarkable proofs of tenacity. A man of action as well as a\
  \ man of thought, all he did was without effort to one of his vigorous and sanguine\
  \ temperament. Learned, clear\u2011headed, and practical, he fulfilled in all emergencies\
  \ those three conditions which united ought to insure human success?activity of\
  \ mind and body, impetuous wishes, and powerful will. He might have taken for his\
  \ motto that of William of Orange in the 17th century: \u201CI can undertake and\
  \ persevere even without hope of success.\u201D Cyrus Harding was courage personified.\
  \ He had been in all the battles of that war. After having begun as a volunteer\
  \ at Illinois, under Ulysses Grant, he fought at Paducah, Belmont, Pittsburg Landing,\
  \ at the siege of Corinth, Port Gibson, Black River, Chattanooga, the Wilderness,\
  \ on the Potomac, everywhere and valiantly, a soldier worthy of the general who\
  \ said, \u201CI never count my dead!\u201D And hundreds of times Captain Harding\
  \ had almost been among those who were not counted by the terrible Grant; but in\
  \ these combats where he never spared himself, fortune favored him till the moment\
  \ when he was wounded and taken prisoner on the field of battle near Richmond. At\
  \ the same time and on the same day another important personage fell into the hands\
  \ of the Southerners. This was no other than Gideon Spilett, a reporter for the\
  \ New York Herald, who had been ordered to follow the changes of the war in the\
  \ midst of the Northern armies.</p>"
- "<p>Gideon Spilett was one of that race of indomitable English or American chroniclers,\
  \ like Stanley and others, who stop at nothing to obtain exact information, and\
  \ transmit it to their journal in the shortest possible time. The newspapers of\
  \ the Union, such as the New York Herald, are genuine powers, and their reporters\
  \ are men to be reckoned with. Gideon Spilett ranked among the first of those reporters:\
  \ a man of great merit, energetic, prompt and ready for anything, full of ideas,\
  \ having traveled over the whole world, soldier and artist, enthusiastic in council,\
  \ resolute in action, caring neither for trouble, fatigue, nor danger, when in pursuit\
  \ of information, for himself first, and then for his journal, a perfect treasury\
  \ of knowledge on all sorts of curious subjects, of the unpublished, of the unknown,\
  \ and of the impossible. He was one of those intrepid observers who write under\
  \ fire, \u201Creporting\u201D among bullets, and to whom every danger is welcome.</p>"
- "<p>He also had been in all the battles, in the first rank, revolver in one hand,\
  \ note\u2011book in the other; grape\u2011shot never made his pencil tremble. He\
  \ did not fatigue the wires with incessant telegrams, like those who speak when\
  \ they have nothing to say, but each of his notes, short, decisive, and clear, threw\
  \ light on some important point. Besides, he was not wanting in humor. It was he\
  \ who, after the affair of the Black River, determined at any cost to keep his place\
  \ at the wicket of the telegraph office, and after having announced to his journal\
  \ the result of the battle, telegraphed for two hours the first chapters of the\
  \ Bible. It cost the New York Herald two thousand dollars, but the New York Herald\
  \ published the first intelligence.</p>"
- <p>Gideon Spilett was tall. He was rather more than forty years of age. Light whiskers
  bordering on red surrounded his face. His eye was steady, lively, rapid in its changes.
  It was the eye of a man accustomed to take in at a glance all the details of a scene.
  Well built, he was inured to all climates, like a bar of steel hardened in cold
  water.</p>
- "<p>For ten years Gideon Spilett had been the reporter of the New York Herald, which\
  \ he enriched by his letters and drawings, for he was as skilful in the use of the\
  \ pencil as of the pen. When he was captured, he was in the act of making a description\
  \ and sketch of the battle. The last words in his note\u2011book were these: \u201C\
  A Southern rifleman has just taken aim at me, but?\u201D The Southerner notwithstanding\
  \ missed Gideon Spilett, who, with his usual fortune, came out of this affair without\
  \ a scratch.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, who did not know each other except by reputation,\
  \ had both been carried to Richmond. The engineer\u2019s wounds rapidly healed,\
  \ and it was during his convalescence that he made acquaintance with the reporter.\
  \ The two men then learned to appreciate each other. Soon their common aim had but\
  \ one object, that of escaping, rejoining Grant\u2019s army, and fighting together\
  \ in the ranks of the Federals.</p>"
- "<p>The two Americans had from the first determined to seize every chance; but although\
  \ they were allowed to wander at liberty in the town, Richmond was so strictly guarded,\
  \ that escape appeared impossible. In the meanwhile Captain Harding was rejoined\
  \ by a servant who was devoted to him in life and in death. This intrepid fellow\
  \ was a Negro born on the engineer\u2019s estate, of a slave father and mother,\
  \ but to whom Cyrus, who was an Abolitionist from conviction and heart, had long\
  \ since given his freedom. The once slave, though free, would not leave his master.\
  \ He would have died for him. He was a man of about thirty, vigorous, active, clever,\
  \ intelligent, gentle, and calm, sometimes naive, always merry, obliging, and honest.\
  \ His name was Nebuchadnezzar, but he only answered to the familiar abbreviation\
  \ of Neb.</p>"
- <p>When Neb heard that his master had been made prisoner, he left Massachusetts
  without hesitating an instant, arrived before Richmond, and by dint of stratagem
  and shrewdness, after having risked his life twenty times over, managed to penetrate
  into the besieged town. The pleasure of Harding on seeing his servant, and the joy
  of Neb at finding his master, can scarcely be described.</p>
- <p>But though Neb had been able to make his way into Richmond, it was quite another
  thing to get out again, for the Northern prisoners were very strictly watched. Some
  extraordinary opportunity was needed to make the attempt with any chance of success,
  and this opportunity not only did not present itself, but was very difficult to
  find.</p>
- <p>Meanwhile Grant continued his energetic operations. The victory of Petersburg
  had been very dearly bought. His forces, united to those of Butler, had as yet been
  unsuccessful before Richmond, and nothing gave the prisoners any hope of a speedy
  deliverance.</p>
- "<p>The reporter, to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a single incident\
  \ worthy of note, could stand it no longer. His usually active mind was occupied\
  \ with one sole thought?how he might get out of Richmond at any cost. Several times\
  \ had he even made the attempt, but was stopped by some insurmountable obstacle.\
  \ However, the siege continued; and if the prisoners were anxious to escape and\
  \ join Grant\u2019s army, certain of the besieged were no less anxious to join the\
  \ Southern forces. Among them was one Jonathan Forster, a determined Southerner.\
  \ The truth was, that if the prisoners of the Secessionists could not leave the\
  \ town, neither could the Secessionists themselves while the Northern army invested\
  \ it. The Governor of Richmond for a long time had been unable to communicate with\
  \ General Lee, and he very much wished to make known to him the situation of the\
  \ town, so as to hasten the march of the army to their relief. Thus Jonathan Forster\
  \ accordingly conceived the idea of rising in a balloon, so as to pass over the\
  \ besieging lines, and in that way reach the Secessionist camp.</p>"
- <p>The Governor authorized the attempt. A balloon was manufactured and placed at
  the disposal of Forster, who was to be accompanied by five other persons. They were
  furnished with arms in case they might have to defend themselves when they alighted,
  and provisions in the event of their aerial voyage being prolonged.</p>
- "<p>The departure of the balloon was fixed for the 18th of March. It should be effected\
  \ during the night, with a northwest wind of moderate force, and the aeronauts calculated\
  \ that they would reach General Lee\u2019s camp in a few hours.</p>"
- "<p>But this northwest wind was not a simple breeze. From the 18th it was evident\
  \ that it was changing to a hurricane. The tempest soon became such that Forster\u2019\
  s departure was deferred, for it was impossible to risk the balloon and those whom\
  \ it carried in the midst of the furious elements.</p>"
- <p>The balloon, inflated on the great square of Richmond, was ready to depart on
  the first abatement of the wind, and, as may be supposed, the impatience among the
  besieged to see the storm moderate was very great.</p>
- <p>The 18th, the 19th of March passed without any alteration in the weather. There
  was even great difficulty in keeping the balloon fastened to the ground, as the
  squalls dashed it furiously about.</p>
- <p>The night of the 19th passed, but the next morning the storm blew with redoubled
  force. The departure of the balloon was impossible.</p>
- "<p>On that day the engineer, Cyrus Harding, was accosted in one of the streets\
  \ of Richmond by a person whom he did not in the least know. This was a sailor named\
  \ Pencroft, a man of about thirty\u2011five or forty years of age, strongly built,\
  \ very sunburnt, and possessed of a pair of bright sparkling eyes and a remarkably\
  \ good physiognomy. Pencroft was an American from the North, who had sailed all\
  \ the ocean over, and who had gone through every possible and almost impossible\
  \ adventure that a being with two feet and no wings would encounter. It is needless\
  \ to say that he was a bold, dashing fellow, ready to dare anything and was astonished\
  \ at nothing. Pencroft at the beginning of the year had gone to Richmond on business,\
  \ with a young boy of fifteen from New Jersey, son of a former captain, an orphan,\
  \ whom he loved as if he had been his own child. Not having been able to leave the\
  \ town before the first operations of the siege, he found himself shut up, to his\
  \ great disgust; but, not accustomed to succumb to difficulties, he resolved to\
  \ escape by some means or other. He knew the engineer\u2011officer by reputation;\
  \ he knew with what impatience that determined man chafed under his restraint. On\
  \ this day he did not, therefore, hesitate to accost him, saying, without circumlocution,\
  \ \u201CHave you had enough of Richmond, captain?\u201D</p>"
- <p>The engineer looked fixedly at the man who spoke, and who added, in a low voice,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Harding, will you try to escape?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhen?\u201D asked the engineer quickly, and it was evident that this question\
  \ was uttered without consideration, for he had not yet examined the stranger who\
  \ addressed him. But after having with a penetrating eye observed the open face\
  \ of the sailor, he was convinced that he had before him an honest man.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho are you?\u201D he asked briefly.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft made himself known.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D replied Harding, \u201Cand in what way do you propose to escape?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CBy that lazy balloon which is left there doing nothing, and which looks\
  \ to me as if it was waiting on purpose for us?\u201D</p>"
- <p>There was no necessity for the sailor to finish his sentence. The engineer understood
  him at once. He seized Pencroft by the arm, and dragged him to his house. There
  the sailor developed his project, which was indeed extremely simple. They risked
  nothing but their lives in its execution. The hurricane was in all its violence,
  it is true, but so clever and daring an engineer as Cyrus Harding knew perfectly
  well how to manage a balloon. Had he himself been as well acquainted with the art
  of sailing in the air as he was with the navigation of a ship, Pencroft would not
  have hesitated to set out, of course taking his young friend Herbert with him; for,
  accustomed to brave the fiercest tempests of the ocean, he was not to be hindered
  on account of the hurricane.</p>
- "<p>Captain Harding had listened to the sailor without saying a word, but his eyes\
  \ shone with satisfaction. Here was the long\u2011sought\u2011for opportunity?he\
  \ was not a man to let it pass. The plan was feasible, though, it must be confessed,\
  \ dangerous in the extreme. In the night, in spite of their guards, they might approach\
  \ the balloon, slip into the car, and then cut the cords which held it. There was\
  \ no doubt that they might be killed, but on the other hand they might succeed,\
  \ and without this storm!?Without this storm the balloon would have started already\
  \ and the looked\u2011for opportunity would not have then presented itself.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am not alone!\u201D said Harding at last.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHow many people do you wish to bring with you?\u201D asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTwo; my friend Spilett, and my servant Neb.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat will be three,\u201D replied Pencroft; \u201Cand with Herbert and\
  \ me five. But the balloon will hold six?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat will be enough, we will go,\u201D answered Harding in a firm voice.</p>"
- "<p>This \u201Cwe\u201D included Spilett, for the reporter, as his friend well knew,\
  \ was not a man to draw back, and when the project was communicated to him he approved\
  \ of it unreservedly. What astonished him was, that so simple an idea had not occurred\
  \ to him before. As to Neb, he followed his master wherever his master wished to\
  \ go.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis evening, then,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cwe will all meet out there.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis evening, at ten o\u2019clock,\u201D replied Captain Harding; \u201C\
  and Heaven grant that the storm does not abate before our departure.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft took leave of the two friends, and returned to his lodging, where young\
  \ Herbert Brown had remained. The courageous boy knew of the sailor\u2019s plan,\
  \ and it was not without anxiety that he awaited the result of the proposal being\
  \ made to the engineer. Thus five determined persons were about to abandon themselves\
  \ to the mercy of the tempestuous elements!</p>"
- <p>No! the storm did not abate, and neither Jonathan Forster nor his companions
  dreamed of confronting it in that frail car.</p>
- "<p>It would be a terrible journey. The engineer only feared one thing; it was that\
  \ the balloon, held to the ground and dashed about by the wind, would be torn into\
  \ shreds. For several hours he roamed round the nearly\u2011deserted square, surveying\
  \ the apparatus. Pencroft did the same on his side, his hands in his pockets, yawning\
  \ now and then like a man who did not know how to kill the time, but really dreading,\
  \ like his friend, either the escape or destruction of the balloon. Evening arrived.\
  \ The night was dark in the extreme. Thick mists passed like clouds close to the\
  \ ground. Rain fell mingled with snow, it was very cold. A mist hung over Richmond.\
  \ It seemed as if the violent storm had produced a truce between the besiegers and\
  \ the besieged, and that the cannon were silenced by the louder detonations of the\
  \ storm. The streets of the town were deserted. It had not even appeared necessary\
  \ in that horrible weather to place a guard in the square, in the midst of which\
  \ plunged the balloon. Everything favored the departure of the prisoners, but what\
  \ might possibly be the termination of the hazardous voyage they contemplated in\
  \ the midst of the furious elements??</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDirty weather!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, fixing his hat firmly on his\
  \ head with a blow of his fist; \u201Cbut pshaw, we shall succeed all the same!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>At half\u2011past nine, Harding and his companions glided from different directions\
  \ into the square, which the gas\u2011lamps, extinguished by the wind, had left\
  \ in total obscurity. Even the enormous balloon, almost beaten to the ground, could\
  \ not be seen. Independently of the sacks of ballast, to which the cords of the\
  \ net were fastened, the car was held by a strong cable passed through a ring in\
  \ the pavement. The five prisoners met by the car. They had not been perceived,\
  \ and such was the darkness that they could not even see each other.</p>"
- "<p>Without speaking a word, Harding, Spilett, Neb, and Herbert took their places\
  \ in the car, while Pencroft by the engineer\u2019s order detached successively\
  \ the bags of ballast. It was the work of a few minutes only, and the sailor rejoined\
  \ his companions.</p>"
- <p>The balloon was then only held by the cable, and the engineer had nothing to
  do but to give the word.</p>
- <p>At that moment a dog sprang with a bound into the car. It was Top, a favorite
  of the engineer. The faithful creature, having broken his chain, had followed his
  master. He, however, fearing that its additional weight might impede their ascent,
  wished to send away the animal.</p>
- "<p>\u201COne more will make but little difference, poor beast!\u201D exclaimed\
  \ Pencroft, heaving out two bags of sand, and as he spoke letting go the cable;\
  \ the balloon ascending in an oblique direction, disappeared, after having dashed\
  \ the car against two chimneys, which it threw down as it swept by them.</p>"
- <p>Then, indeed, the full rage of the hurricane was exhibited to the voyagers. During
  the night the engineer could not dream of descending, and when day broke, even a
  glimpse of the earth below was intercepted by fog.</p>
- <p>Five days had passed when a partial clearing allowed them to see the wide extending
  ocean beneath their feet, now lashed into the maddest fury by the gale.</p>
- <p>Our readers will recollect what befell these five daring individuals who set
  out on their hazardous expedition in the balloon on the 20th of March. Five days
  afterwards four of them were thrown on a desert coast, seven thousand miles from
  their country! But one of their number was missing, the man who was to be their
  guide, their leading spirit, the engineer, Captain Harding! The instant they had
  recovered their feet, they all hurried to the beach in the hopes of rendering him
  assistance.</p>
- <p>Chapter 3</p>
- "<p>The engineer, the meshes of the net having given way, had been carried off by\
  \ a wave. His dog also had disappeared. The faithful animal had voluntarily leaped\
  \ out to help his master. \u201CForward,\u201D cried the reporter; and all four,\
  \ Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb, forgetting their fatigue, began their search.\
  \ Poor Neb shed bitter tears, giving way to despair at the thought of having lost\
  \ the only being he loved on earth.</p>"
- "<p>Only two minutes had passed from the time when Cyrus Harding disappeared to\
  \ the moment when his companions set foot on the ground. They had hopes therefore\
  \ of arriving in time to save him. \u201CLet us look for him! let us look for him!\u201D\
  \ cried Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Neb,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, \u201Cand we will find him too!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CLiving, I trust!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CStill living!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCan he swim?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Neb, \u201Cand besides, Top is there.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The sailor, observing the heavy surf on the shore, shook his head.</p>
- <p>The engineer had disappeared to the north of the shore, and nearly half a mile
  from the place where the castaways had landed. The nearest point of the beach he
  could reach was thus fully that distance off.</p>
- "<p>It was then nearly six o\u2019clock. A thick fog made the night very dark. The\
  \ castaways proceeded toward the north of the land on which chance had thrown them,\
  \ an unknown region, the geographical situation of which they could not even guess.\
  \ They were walking upon a sandy soil, mingled with stones, which appeared destitute\
  \ of any sort of vegetation. The ground, very unequal and rough, was in some places\
  \ perfectly riddled with holes, making walking extremely painful. From these holes\
  \ escaped every minute great birds of clumsy flight, which flew in all directions.\
  \ Others, more active, rose in flocks and passed in clouds over their heads. The\
  \ sailor thought he recognized gulls and cormorants, whose shrill cries rose above\
  \ the roaring of the sea.</p>"
- <p>From time to time the castaways stopped and shouted, then listened for some response
  from the ocean, for they thought that if the engineer had landed, and they had been
  near to the place, they would have heard the barking of the dog Top, even should
  Harding himself have been unable to give any sign of existence. They stopped to
  listen, but no sound arose above the roaring of the waves and the dashing of the
  surf. The little band then continued their march forward, searching into every hollow
  of the shore.</p>
- <p>After walking for twenty minutes, the four castaways were suddenly brought to
  a standstill by the sight of foaming billows close to their feet. The solid ground
  ended here. They found themselves at the extremity of a sharp point on which the
  sea broke furiously.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is a promontory,\u201D said the sailor; \u201Cwe must retrace our steps,\
  \ holding towards the right, and we shall thus gain the mainland.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut if he is there,\u201D said Neb, pointing to the ocean, whose waves\
  \ shone of a snowy white in the darkness. \u201CWell, let us call again,\u201D and\
  \ all uniting their voices, they gave a vigorous shout, but there came no reply.\
  \ They waited for a lull, then began again; still no reply.</p>"
- <p>The castaways accordingly returned, following the opposite side of the promontory,
  over a soil equally sandy and rugged. However, Pencroft observed that the shore
  was more equal, that the ground rose, and he declared that it was joined by a long
  slope to a hill, whose massive front he thought that he could see looming indistinctly
  through the mist. The birds were less numerous on this part of the shore; the sea
  was also less tumultuous, and they observed that the agitation of the waves was
  diminished. The noise of the surf was scarcely heard. This side of the promontory
  evidently formed a semicircular bay, which the sharp point sheltered from the breakers
  of the open sea. But to follow this direction was to go south, exactly opposite
  to that part of the coast where Harding might have landed. After a walk of a mile
  and a half, the shore presented no curve which would permit them to return to the
  north. This promontory, of which they had turned the point, must be attached to
  the mainland. The castaways, although their strength was nearly exhausted, still
  marched courageously forward, hoping every moment to meet with a sudden angle which
  would set them in the first direction. What was their disappointment, when, after
  trudging nearly two miles, having reached an elevated point composed of slippery
  rocks, they found themselves again stopped by the sea.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe are on an islet,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cand we have surveyed it\
  \ from one extremity to the other.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The sailor was right; they had been thrown, not on a continent, not even on an
  island, but on an islet which was not more than two miles in length, with even a
  less breadth.</p>
- "<p>Was this barren spot the desolate refuge of sea\u2011birds, strewn with stones\
  \ and destitute of vegetation, attached to a more important archipelago? It was\
  \ impossible to say. When the voyagers from their car saw the land through the mist,\
  \ they had not been able to reconnoiter it sufficiently. However, Pencroft, accustomed\
  \ with his sailor eyes to piece through the gloom, was almost certain that he could\
  \ clearly distinguish in the west confused masses which indicated an elevated coast.\
  \ But they could not in the dark determine whether it was a single island, or connected\
  \ with others. They could not leave it either, as the sea surrounded them; they\
  \ must therefore put off till the next day their search for the engineer, from whom,\
  \ alas! not a single cry had reached them to show that he was still in existence.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe silence of our friend proves nothing,\u201D said the reporter. \u201C\
  Perhaps he has fainted or is wounded, and unable to reply directly, so we will not\
  \ despair.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The reporter then proposed to light a fire on a point of the islet, which would\
  \ serve as a signal to the engineer. But they searched in vain for wood or dry brambles;\
  \ nothing but sand and stones were to be found. The grief of Neb and his companions,\
  \ who were all strongly attached to the intrepid Harding, can be better pictured\
  \ than described. It was too evident that they were powerless to help him. They\
  \ must wait with what patience they could for daylight. Either the engineer had\
  \ been able to save himself, and had already found a refuge on some point of the\
  \ coast, or he was lost for ever! The long and painful hours passed by. The cold\
  \ was intense. The castaways suffered cruelly, but they scarcely perceived it. They\
  \ did not even think of taking a minute\u2019s rest. Forgetting everything but their\
  \ chief, hoping or wishing to hope on, they continued to walk up and down on this\
  \ sterile spot, always returning to its northern point, where they could approach\
  \ nearest to the scene of the catastrophe. They listened, they called, and then\
  \ uniting their voices, they endeavored to raise even a louder shout than before,\
  \ which would be transmitted to a great distance. The wind had now fallen almost\
  \ to a calm, and the noise of the sea began also to subside. One of Neb\u2019s shouts\
  \ even appeared to produce an echo. Herbert directed Pencroft\u2019s attention to\
  \ it, adding, \u201CThat proves that there is a coast to the west, at no great distance.\u201D\
  \ The sailor nodded; besides, his eyes could not deceive him. If he had discovered\
  \ land, however indistinct it might appear, land was sure to be there. But that\
  \ distant echo was the only response produced by Neb\u2019s shouts, while a heavy\
  \ gloom hung over all the part east of the island.</p>"
- <p>Meanwhile, the sky was clearing little by little. Towards midnight the stars
  shone out, and if the engineer had been there with his companions he would have
  remarked that these stars did not belong to the Northern Hemisphere. The Polar Star
  was not visible, the constellations were not those which they had been accustomed
  to see in the United States; the Southern Cross glittered brightly in the sky.</p>
- "<p>The night passed away. Towards five o\u2019clock in the morning of the 25th\
  \ of March, the sky began to lighten; the horizon still remained dark, but with\
  \ daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea, so that the eye could scarcely penetrate\
  \ beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood. At length the fog gradually unrolled\
  \ itself in great heavily moving waves.</p>"
- "<p>It was unfortunate, however, that the castaways could distinguish nothing around\
  \ them. While the gaze of the reporter and Neb were cast upon the ocean, the sailor\
  \ and Herbert looked eagerly for the coast in the west. But not a speck of land\
  \ was visible. \u201CNever mind,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cthough I do not see\
  \ the land, I feel it... it is there... there... as sure as the fact that we are\
  \ no longer at Richmond.\u201D But the fog was not long in rising. It was only a\
  \ fine\u2011weather mist. A hot sun soon penetrated to the surface of the island.\
  \ About half\u2011past six, three\u2011quarters of an hour after sunrise, the mist\
  \ became more transparent. It grew thicker above, but cleared away below. Soon the\
  \ isle appeared as if it had descended from a cloud, then the sea showed itself\
  \ around them, spreading far away towards the east, but bounded on the west by an\
  \ abrupt and precipitous coast.</p>"
- <p>Yes! the land was there. Their safety was at least provisionally insured. The
  islet and the coast were separated by a channel about half a mile in breadth, through
  which rushed an extremely rapid current.</p>
- "<p>However, one of the castaways, following the impulse of his heart, immediately\
  \ threw himself into the current, without consulting his companions, without saying\
  \ a single word. It was Neb. He was in haste to be on the other side, and to climb\
  \ towards the north. It had been impossible to hold him back. Pencroft called him\
  \ in vain. The reporter prepared to follow him, but Pencroft stopped him. \u201C\
  Do you want to cross the channel?\u201D he asked. \u201CYes,\u201D replied Spilett.\
  \ \u201CAll right!\u201D said the seaman; \u201Cwait a bit; Neb is well able to\
  \ carry help to his master. If we venture into the channel, we risk being carried\
  \ into the open sea by the current, which is running very strong; but, if I\u2019\
  m not wrong, it is ebbing. See, the tide is going down over the sand. Let us have\
  \ patience, and at low water it is possible we may find a fordable passage.\u201D\
  \ \u201CYou are right,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Cwe will not separate more\
  \ than we can help.\u201D</p>"
- <p>During this time Neb was struggling vigorously against the current. He was crossing
  in an oblique direction. His black shoulders could be seen emerging at each stroke.
  He was carried down very quickly, but he also made way towards the shore. It took
  more than half an hour to cross from the islet to the land, and he reached the shore
  several hundred feet from the place which was opposite to the point from which he
  had started.</p>
- <p>Landing at the foot of a high wall of granite, he shook himself vigorously; and
  then, setting off running, soon disappeared behind a rocky point, which projected
  to nearly the height of the northern extremity of the islet.</p>
- "<p>Neb\u2019s companions had watched his daring attempt with painful anxiety, and\
  \ when he was out of sight, they fixed their attention on the land where their hope\
  \ of safety lay, while eating some shell\u2011fish with which the sand was strewn.\
  \ It was a wretched repast, but still it was better than nothing. The opposite coast\
  \ formed one vast bay, terminating on the south by a very sharp point, which was\
  \ destitute of all vegetation, and was of a very wild aspect. This point abutted\
  \ on the shore in a grotesque outline of high granite rocks. Towards the north,\
  \ on the contrary, the bay widened, and a more rounded coast appeared, trending\
  \ from the southwest to the northeast, and terminating in a slender cape. The distance\
  \ between these two extremities, which made the bow of the bay, was about eight\
  \ miles. Half a mile from the shore rose the islet, which somewhat resembled the\
  \ carcass of a gigantic whale. Its extreme breadth was not more than a quarter of\
  \ a mile.</p>"
- "<p>Opposite the islet, the beach consisted first of sand, covered with black stones,\
  \ which were now appearing little by little above the retreating tide. The second\
  \ level was separated by a perpendicular granite cliff, terminated at the top by\
  \ an unequal edge at a height of at least 300 feet. It continued thus for a length\
  \ of three miles, ending suddenly on the right with a precipice which looked as\
  \ if cut by the hand of man. On the left, above the promontory, this irregular and\
  \ jagged cliff descended by a long slope of conglomerated rocks till it mingled\
  \ with the ground of the southern point. On the upper plateau of the coast not a\
  \ tree appeared. It was a flat tableland like that above Cape Town at the Cape of\
  \ Good Hope, but of reduced proportions; at least so it appeared seen from the islet.\
  \ However, verdure was not wanting to the right beyond the precipice. They could\
  \ easily distinguish a confused mass of great trees, which extended beyond the limits\
  \ of their view. This verdure relieved the eye, so long wearied by the continued\
  \ ranges of granite. Lastly, beyond and above the plateau, in a northwesterly direction\
  \ and at a distance of at least seven miles, glittered a white summit which reflected\
  \ the sun\u2019s rays. It was that of a lofty mountain, capped with snow.</p>"
- <p>The question could not at present be decided whether this land formed an island,
  or whether it belonged to a continent. But on beholding the convulsed masses heaped
  up on the left, no geologist would have hesitated to give them a volcanic origin,
  for they were unquestionably the work of subterranean convulsions.</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert attentively examined this land, on which
  they might perhaps have to live many long years; on which indeed they might even
  die, should it be out of the usual track of vessels, as was likely to be the case.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D asked Herbert, \u201Cwhat do you say, Pencroft?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere is some good and some bad, as in everything,\u201D replied the sailor.\
  \ \u201CWe shall see. But now the ebb is evidently making. In three hours we will\
  \ attempt the passage, and once on the other side, we will try to get out of this\
  \ scrape, and I hope may find the captain.\u201D Pencroft was not wrong in his anticipations.\
  \ Three hours later at low tide, the greater part of the sand forming the bed of\
  \ the channel was uncovered. Between the islet and the coast there only remained\
  \ a narrow channel which would no doubt be easy to cross.</p>"
- "<p>About ten o\u2019clock, Gideon Spilett and his companions stripped themselves\
  \ of their clothes, which they placed in bundles on their heads, and then ventured\
  \ into the water, which was not more than five feet deep. Herbert, for whom it was\
  \ too deep, swam like a fish, and got through capitally. All three arrived without\
  \ difficulty on the opposite shore. Quickly drying themselves in the sun, they put\
  \ on their clothes, which they had preserved from contact with the water, and sat\
  \ down to take counsel together what to do next.</p>"
- <p>Chapter 4</p>
- <p>All at once the reporter sprang up, and telling the sailor that he would rejoin
  them at that same place, he climbed the cliff in the direction which the Negro Neb
  had taken a few hours before. Anxiety hastened his steps, for he longed to obtain
  news of his friend, and he soon disappeared round an angle of the cliff. Herbert
  wished to accompany him.</p>
- "<p>\u201CStop here, my boy,\u201D said the sailor; \u201Cwe have to prepare an\
  \ encampment, and to try and find rather better grub than these shell\u2011fish.\
  \ Our friends will want something when they come back. There is work for everybody.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am ready,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAll right,\u201D said the sailor; \u201Cthat will do. We must set about\
  \ it regularly. We are tired, cold, and hungry; therefore we must have shelter,\
  \ fire, and food. There is wood in the forest, and eggs in nests; we have only to\
  \ find a house.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery well,\u201D returned Herbert, \u201CI will look for a cave among\
  \ the rocks, and I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can creep.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAll right,\u201D said Pencroft; \u201Cgo on, my boy.\u201D</p>"
- <p>They both walked to the foot of the enormous wall over the beach, far from which
  the tide had now retreated; but instead of going towards the north, they went southward.
  Pencroft had remarked, several hundred feet from the place at which they landed,
  a narrow cutting, out of which he thought a river or stream might issue. Now, on
  the one hand it was important to settle themselves in the neighborhood of a good
  stream of water, and on the other it was possible that the current had thrown Cyrus
  Harding on the shore there.</p>
- "<p>The cliff, as has been said, rose to a height of three hundred feet, but the\
  \ mass was unbroken throughout, and even at its base, scarcely washed by the sea,\
  \ it did not offer the smallest fissure which would serve as a dwelling. It was\
  \ a perpendicular wall of very hard granite, which even the waves had not worn away.\
  \ Towards the summit fluttered myriads of sea\u2011fowl, and especially those of\
  \ the web\u2011footed species with long, flat, pointed beaks?a clamorous tribe,\
  \ bold in the presence of man, who probably for the first time thus invaded their\
  \ domains. Pencroft recognized the skua and other gulls among them, the voracious\
  \ little sea\u2011mew, which in great numbers nestled in the crevices of the granite.\
  \ A shot fired among this swarm would have killed a great number, but to fire a\
  \ shot a gun was needed, and neither Pencroft nor Herbert had one; besides this,\
  \ gulls and sea\u2011mews are scarcely eatable, and even their eggs have a detestable\
  \ taste. However, Herbert, who had gone forward a little more to the left, soon\
  \ came upon rocks covered with sea\u2011weed, which, some hours later, would be\
  \ hidden by the high tide. On these rocks, in the midst of slippery wrack, abounded\
  \ bivalve shell\u2011fish, not to be despised by starving people. Herbert called\
  \ Pencroft, who ran up hastily.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHere are mussels!\u201D cried the sailor; \u201Cthese will do instead\
  \ of eggs!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey are not mussels,\u201D replied Herbert, who was attentively examining\
  \ the molluscs attached to the rocks; \u201Cthey are lithodomes.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAre they good to eat?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerfectly so.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen let us eat some lithodomes.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The sailor could rely upon Herbert; the young boy was well up in natural history,
  and always had had quite a passion for the science. His father had encouraged him
  in it, by letting him attend the lectures of the best professors in Boston, who
  were very fond of the intelligent, industrious lad. And his turn for natural history
  was, more than once in the course of time, of great use, and he was not mistaken
  in this instance. These lithodomes were oblong shells, suspended in clusters and
  adhering very tightly to the rocks. They belong to that species of molluscous perforators
  which excavate holes in the hardest stone; their shell is rounded at both ends,
  a feature which is not remarked in the common mussel.</p>
- <p>Pencroft and Herbert made a good meal of the lithodomes, which were then half
  opened to the sun. They ate them as oysters, and as they had a strong peppery taste,
  they were palatable without condiments of any sort.</p>
- "<p>Their hunger was thus appeased for the time, but not their thirst, which increased\
  \ after eating these naturally\u2011spiced molluscs. They had then to find fresh\
  \ water, and it was not likely that it would be wanting in such a capriciously uneven\
  \ region. Pencroft and Herbert, after having taken the precaution of collecting\
  \ an ample supply of lithodomes, with which they filled their pockets and handkerchiefs,\
  \ regained the foot of the cliff.</p>"
- <p>Two hundred paces farther they arrived at the cutting, through which, as Pencroft
  had guessed, ran a stream of water, whether fresh or not was to be ascertained.
  At this place the wall appeared to have been separated by some violent subterranean
  force. At its base was hollowed out a little creek, the farthest part of which formed
  a tolerably sharp angle. The watercourse at that part measured one hundred feet
  in breadth, and its two banks on each side were scarcely twenty feet high. The river
  became strong almost directly between the two walls of granite, which began to sink
  above the mouth; it then suddenly turned and disappeared beneath a wood of stunted
  trees half a mile off.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHere is the water, and yonder is the wood we require!\u201D said Pencroft.\
  \ \u201CWell, Herbert, now we only want the house.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The water of the river was limpid. The sailor ascertained that at this time?that
  is to say, at low tide, when the rising floods did not reach it?it was sweet. This
  important point established, Herbert looked for some cavity which would serve them
  as a retreat, but in vain; everywhere the wall appeared smooth, plain, and perpendicular.</p>
- "<p>However, at the mouth of the watercourse and above the reach of the high tide,\
  \ the convulsions of nature had formed, not a grotto, but a pile of enormous rocks,\
  \ such as are often met with in granite countries and which bear the name of \u201C\
  Chimneys.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft and Herbert penetrated quite far in among the rocks, by sandy passages\
  \ in which light was not wanting, for it entered through the openings which were\
  \ left between the blocks, of which some were only sustained by a miracle of equilibrium;\
  \ but with the light came also air?a regular corridor\u2011gale?and with the wind\
  \ the sharp cold from the exterior. However, the sailor thought that by stopping\u2011\
  up some of the openings with a mixture of stones and sand, the Chimneys could be\
  \ rendered habitable. Their geometrical plan represented the typographical sign\
  \ \u201C&,\u201D which signifies \u201Cet cetera\u201D abridged, but by isolating\
  \ the upper mouth of the sign, through which the south and west winds blew so strongly,\
  \ they could succeed in making the lower part of use.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHere\u2019s our work,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cand if we ever see Captain\
  \ Harding again, he will know how to make something of this labyrinth.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall see him again, Pencroft,\u201D cried Herbert, \u201Cand when\
  \ he returns he must find a tolerable dwelling here. It will be so, if we can make\
  \ a fireplace in the left passage and keep an opening for the smoke.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSo we can, my boy,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cand these Chimneys\
  \ will serve our turn. Let us set to work, but first come and get a store of fuel.\
  \ I think some branches will be very useful in stopping up these openings, through\
  \ which the wind shrieks like so many fiends.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Herbert and Pencroft left the Chimneys, and, turning the angle, they began to
  climb the left bank of the river. The current here was quite rapid, and drifted
  down some dead wood. The rising tide?and it could already be perceived?must drive
  it back with force to a considerable distance. The sailor then thought that they
  could utilize this ebb and flow for the transport of heavy objects.</p>
- "<p>After having walked for a quarter of an hour, the sailor and the boy arrived\
  \ at the angle which the river made in turning towards the left. From this point\
  \ its course was pursued through a forest of magnificent trees. These trees still\
  \ retained their verdure, notwithstanding the advanced season, for they belonged\
  \ to the family of \u201Cconiferae,\u201D which is spread over all the regions of\
  \ the globe, from northern climates to the tropics. The young naturalist recognized\
  \ especially the \u201Cdeedara,\u201D which are very numerous in the Himalayan zone,\
  \ and which spread around them a most agreeable odor. Between these beautiful trees\
  \ sprang up clusters of firs, whose opaque open parasol boughs spread wide around.\
  \ Among the long grass, Pencroft felt that his feet were crushing dry branches which\
  \ crackled like fireworks.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, my boy,\u201D said he to Herbert, \u201Cif I don\u2019t know the\
  \ name of these trees, at any rate I reckon that we may call them ?burning wood,\u2019\
  \ and just now that\u2019s the chief thing we want.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us get a supply,\u201D replied Herbert, who immediately set to work.</p>"
- <p>The collection was easily made. It was not even necessary to lop the trees, for
  enormous quantities of dead wood were lying at their feet; but if fuel was not wanting,
  the means of transporting it was not yet found. The wood, being very dry, would
  burn rapidly; it was therefore necessary to carry to the Chimneys a considerable
  quantity, and the loads of two men would not be sufficient. Herbert remarked this.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, my boy,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cthere must be some way of\
  \ carrying this wood; there is always a way of doing everything. If we had a cart\
  \ or a boat, it would be easy enough.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut we have the river,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CRight,\u201D replied Pencroft; \u201Cthe river will be to us like a road\
  \ which carries of itself, and rafts have not been invented for nothing.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COnly,\u201D observed Herbert, \u201Cat this moment our road is going the\
  \ wrong way, for the tide is rising!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall be all right if we wait till it ebbs,\u201D replied the sailor,\
  \ \u201Cand then we will trust it to carry our fuel to the Chimneys. Let us get\
  \ the raft ready.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The sailor, followed by Herbert, directed his steps towards the river. They\
  \ both carried, each in proportion to his strength, a load of wood bound in fagots.\
  \ They found on the bank also a great quantity of dead branches in the midst of\
  \ grass, among which the foot of man had probably never before trod. Pencroft began\
  \ directly to make his raft. In a kind of little bay, created by a point of the\
  \ shore which broke the current, the sailor and the lad placed some good\u2011sized\
  \ pieces of wood, which they had fastened together with dry creepers. A raft was\
  \ thus formed, on which they stacked all they had collected, sufficient, indeed,\
  \ to have loaded at least twenty men. In an hour the work was finished, and the\
  \ raft moored to the bank, awaited the turning of the tide.</p>"
- <p>There were still several hours to be occupied, and with one consent Pencroft
  and Herbert resolved to gain the upper plateau, so as to have a more extended view
  of the surrounding country.</p>
- <p>Exactly two hundred feet behind the angle formed by the river, the wall, terminated
  by a fall of rocks, died away in a gentle slope to the edge of the forest. It was
  a natural staircase. Herbert and the sailor began their ascent; thanks to the vigor
  of their muscles they reached the summit in a few minutes; and proceeded to the
  point above the mouth of the river.</p>
- <p>On attaining it, their first look was cast upon the ocean which not long before
  they had traversed in such a terrible condition. They observed, with emotion, all
  that part to the north of the coast on which the catastrophe had taken place. It
  was there that Cyrus Harding had disappeared. They looked to see if some portion
  of their balloon, to which a man might possibly cling, yet existed. Nothing! The
  sea was but one vast watery desert. As to the coast, it was solitary also. Neither
  the reporter nor Neb could be anywhere seen. But it was possible that at this time
  they were both too far away to be perceived.</p>
- "<p>\u201CSomething tells me,\u201D cried Herbert, \u201Cthat a man as energetic\
  \ as Captain Harding would not let himself be drowned like other people. He must\
  \ have reached some point of the shore; don\u2019t you think so, Pencroft?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>The sailor shook his head sadly. He little expected ever to see Cyrus Harding\
  \ again; but wishing to leave some hope to Herbert: \u201CDoubtless, doubtless,\u201D\
  \ said he; \u201Cour engineer is a man who would get out of a scrape to which any\
  \ one else would yield.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>In the meantime he examined the coast with great attention. Stretched out below\
  \ them was the sandy shore, bounded on the right of the river\u2019s mouth by lines\
  \ of breakers. The rocks which were visible appeared like amphibious monsters reposing\
  \ in the surf. Beyond the reef, the sea sparkled beneath the sun\u2019s rays. To\
  \ the south a sharp point closed the horizon, and it could not be seen if the land\
  \ was prolonged in that direction, or if it ran southeast and southwest, which would\
  \ have made this coast a very long peninsula. At the northern extremity of the bay\
  \ the outline of the shore was continued to a great distance in a wider curve. There\
  \ the shore was low, flat, without cliffs, and with great banks of sand, which the\
  \ tide left uncovered. Pencroft and Herbert then returned towards the west. Their\
  \ attention was first arrested by the snow\u2011topped mountain which rose at a\
  \ distance of six or seven miles. From its first declivities to within two miles\
  \ of the coast were spread vast masses of wood, relieved by large green patches,\
  \ caused by the presence of evergreen trees. Then, from the edge of this forest\
  \ to the shore extended a plain, scattered irregularly with groups of trees. Here\
  \ and there on the left sparkled through glades the waters of the little river;\
  \ they could trace its winding course back towards the spurs of the mountain, among\
  \ which it seemed to spring. At the point where the sailor had left his raft of\
  \ wood, it began to run between the two high granite walls; but if on the left bank\
  \ the wall remained clear and abrupt, on the right bank, on the contrary, it sank\
  \ gradually, the massive sides changed to isolated rocks, the rocks to stones, the\
  \ stones to shingle running to the extremity of the point.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAre we on an island?\u201D murmured the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt any rate, it seems to be big enough,\u201D replied the lad.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAn island, ever so big, is an island all the same!\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>But this important question could not yet be answered. A more perfect survey
  had to be made to settle the point. As to the land itself, island or continent,
  it appeared fertile, agreeable in its aspect, and varied in its productions.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThis is satisfactory,\u201D observed Pencroft; \u201Cand in our misfortune,\
  \ we must thank Providence for it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGod be praised!\u201D responded Herbert, whose pious heart was full of\
  \ gratitude to the Author of all things.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft and Herbert examined for some time the country on which they had been
  cast; but it was difficult to guess after so hasty an inspection what the future
  had in store for them.</p>
- <p>They then returned, following the southern crest of the granite platform, bordered
  by a long fringe of jagged rocks, of the most whimsical shapes. Some hundreds of
  birds lived there nestled in the holes of the stone; Herbert, jumping over the rocks,
  startled a whole flock of these winged creatures.</p>
- "<p>\u201COh!\u201D cried he, \u201Cthose are not gulls nor sea\u2011mews!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat are they then?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CUpon my word, one would say they were pigeons!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CJust so, but these are wild or rock pigeons. I recognize them by the double\
  \ band of black on the wing, by the white tail, and by their slate\u2011colored\
  \ plumage. But if the rock\u2011pigeon is good to eat, its eggs must be excellent,\
  \ and we will soon see how many they may have left in their nests!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe will not give them time to hatch, unless it is in the shape of an omelet!\u201D\
  \ replied Pencroft merrily.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut what will you make your omelet in?\u201D asked Herbert; \u201Cin your\
  \ hat?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell!\u201D replied the sailor, \u201CI am not quite conjuror enough for\
  \ that; we must come down to eggs in the shell, my boy, and I will undertake to\
  \ despatch the hardest!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft and Herbert attentively examined the cavities in the granite, and they\
  \ really found eggs in some of the hollows. A few dozen being collected, were packed\
  \ in the sailor\u2019s handkerchief, and as the time when the tide would be full\
  \ was approaching, Pencroft and Herbert began to redescend towards the watercourse.\
  \ When they arrived there, it was an hour after midday. The tide had already turned.\
  \ They must now avail themselves of the ebb to take the wood to the mouth. Pencroft\
  \ did not intend to let the raft go away in the current without guidance, neither\
  \ did he mean to embark on it himself to steer it. But a sailor is never at a loss\
  \ when there is a question of cables or ropes, and Pencroft rapidly twisted a cord,\
  \ a few fathoms long, made of dry creepers. This vegetable cable was fastened to\
  \ the after\u2011part of the raft, and the sailor held it in his hand while Herbert,\
  \ pushing off the raft with a long pole, kept it in the current. This succeeded\
  \ capitally. The enormous load of wood drifted down the current. The bank was very\
  \ equal; there was no fear that the raft would run aground, and before two o\u2019\
  clock they arrived at the river\u2019s mouth, a few paces from the Chimneys.</p>"
- <p>Chapter 5</p>
- "<p>Pencroft\u2019s first care, after unloading the raft, was to render the cave\
  \ habitable by stopping up all the holes which made it draughty. Sand, stones, twisted\
  \ branches, wet clay, closed up the galleries open to the south winds. One narrow\
  \ and winding opening at the side was kept, to lead out the smoke and to make the\
  \ fire draw. The cave was thus divided into three or four rooms, if such dark dens\
  \ with which a donkey would scarcely have been contented deserved the name. But\
  \ they were dry, and there was space to stand upright, at least in the principal\
  \ room, which occupied the center. The floor was covered with fine sand, and taking\
  \ all in all they were well pleased with it for want of a better.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps,\u201D said Herbert, while he and Pencroft were working, \u201C\
  our companions have found a superior place to ours.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery likely,\u201D replied the seaman; \u201Cbut, as we don\u2019t know,\
  \ we must work all the same. Better to have two strings to one\u2019s bow than no\
  \ string at all!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh!\u201D exclaimed Herbert, \u201Chow jolly it will be if they were to\
  \ find Captain Harding and were to bring him back with them!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, indeed!\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cthat was a man of the right sort.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWas!\u201D exclaimed Herbert, \u201Cdo you despair of ever seeing him\
  \ again?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGod forbid!\u201D replied the sailor. Their work was soon done, and Pencroft\
  \ declared himself very well satisfied.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNow,\u201D said he, \u201Cour friends can come back when they like. They\
  \ will find a good enough shelter.\u201D</p>"
- <p>They now had only to make a fireplace and to prepare the supper?an easy task.
  Large flat stones were placed on the ground at the opening of the narrow passage
  which had been kept. This, if the smoke did not take the heat out with it, would
  be enough to maintain an equal temperature inside. Their wood was stowed away in
  one of the rooms, and the sailor laid in the fireplace some logs and brushwood.
  The seaman was busy with this, when Herbert asked him if he had any matches.</p>
- "<p>\u201CCertainly,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cand I may say happily, for without\
  \ matches or tinder we should be in a fix.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CStill we might get fire as the savages do,\u201D replied Herbert, \u201C\
  by rubbing two bits of dry stick one against the other.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAll right; try, my boy, and let\u2019s see if you can do anything besides\
  \ exercising your arms.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, it\u2019s a very simple proceeding, and much used in the islands\
  \ of the Pacific.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI don\u2019t deny it,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cbut the savages must\
  \ know how to do it or employ a peculiar wood, for more than once I have tried to\
  \ get fire in that way, but I could never manage it. I must say I prefer matches.\
  \ By the bye, where are my matches?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Pencroft searched in his waistcoat for the box, which was always there, for he
  was a confirmed smoker. He could not find it; he rummaged the pockets of his trousers,
  but, to his horror, he could nowhere discover the box.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHere\u2019s a go!\u201D said he, looking at Herbert. \u201CThe box must\
  \ have fallen out of my pocket and got lost! Surely, Herbert, you must have something?a\
  \ tinder\u2011box?anything that can possibly make fire!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, I haven\u2019t, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The sailor rushed out, followed by the boy. On the sand, among the rocks, near\
  \ the river\u2019s bank, they both searched carefully, but in vain. The box was\
  \ of copper, and therefore would have been easily seen.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPencroft,\u201D asked Herbert, \u201Cdidn\u2019t you throw it out of the\
  \ car?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI knew better than that,\u201D replied the sailor; \u201Cbut such a small\
  \ article could easily disappear in the tumbling about we have gone through. I would\
  \ rather even have lost my pipe! Confound the box! Where can it be?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLook here, the tide is going down,\u201D said Herbert; \u201Clet\u2019\
  s run to the place where we landed.\u201D</p>"
- <p>It was scarcely probable that they would find the box, which the waves had rolled
  about among the pebbles, at high tide, but it was as well to try. Herbert and Pencroft
  walked rapidly to the point where they had landed the day before, about two hundred
  feet from the cave. They hunted there, among the shingle, in the clefts of the rocks,
  but found nothing. If the box had fallen at this place it must have been swept away
  by the waves. As the sea went down, they searched every little crevice with no result.
  It was a grave loss in their circumstances, and for the time irreparable. Pencroft
  could not hide his vexation; he looked very anxious, but said not a word. Herbert
  tried to console him by observing, that if they had found the matches, they would,
  very likely, have been wetted by the sea and useless.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNo, my boy,\u201D replied the sailor; \u201Cthey were in a copper box\
  \ which shut very tightly; and now what are we to do?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall certainly find some way of making a fire,\u201D said Herbert.\
  \ \u201CCaptain Harding or Mr. Spilett will not be without them.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Pencroft; \u201Cbut in the meantime we are without\
  \ fire, and our companions will find but a sorry repast on their return.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D said Herbert quickly, \u201Cdo you think it possible that they\
  \ have no tinder or matches?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI doubt it,\u201D replied the sailor, shaking his head, \u201Cfor neither\
  \ Neb nor Captain Harding smoke, and I believe that Mr. Spilett would rather keep\
  \ his note\u2011book than his match\u2011box.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Herbert did not reply. The loss of the box was certainly to be regretted, but
  the boy was still sure of procuring fire in some way or other. Pencroft, more experienced,
  did not think so, although he was not a man to trouble himself about a small or
  great grievance. At any rate, there was only one thing to be done?to await the return
  of Neb and the reporter; but they must give up the feast of hard eggs which they
  had meant to prepare, and a meal of raw flesh was not an agreeable prospect either
  for themselves or for the others.</p>
- "<p>Before returning to the cave, the sailor and Herbert, in the event of fire being\
  \ positively unattainable, collected some more shell\u2011fish, and then silently\
  \ retraced their steps to their dwelling.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft, his eyes fixed on the ground, still looked for his box. He even climbed
  up the left bank of the river from its mouth to the angle where the raft had been
  moored. He returned to the plateau, went over it in every direction, searched among
  the high grass on the border of the forest, all in vain.</p>
- "<p>It was five in the evening when he and Herbert re\u2011entered the cave. It\
  \ is useless to say that the darkest corners of the passages were ransacked before\
  \ they were obliged to give it up in despair. Towards six o\u2019clock, when the\
  \ sun was disappearing behind the high lands of the west, Herbert, who was walking\
  \ up and down on the strand, signalized the return of Neb and Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>They were returning alone!... The boy\u2019s heart sank; the sailor had not\
  \ been deceived in his forebodings; the engineer, Cyrus Harding, had not been found!</p>"
- <p>The reporter, on his arrival, sat down on a rock, without saying anything. Exhausted
  with fatigue, dying of hunger, he had not strength to utter a word.</p>
- <p>As to Neb, his red eyes showed how he had cried, and the tears which he could
  not restrain told too clearly that he had lost all hope.</p>
- <p>The reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt to recover Cyrus
  Harding. He and Neb had surveyed the coast for a distance of eight miles and consequently
  much beyond the place where the balloon had fallen the last time but one, a fall
  which was followed by the disappearance of the engineer and the dog Top. The shore
  was solitary; not a vestige of a mark. Not even a pebble recently displaced; not
  a trace on the sand; not a human footstep on all that part of the beach. It was
  clear that that portion of the shore had never been visited by a human being. The
  sea was as deserted as the land, and it was there, a few hundred feet from the coast,
  that the engineer must have found a tomb.</p>
- "<p>As Spilett ended his account, Neb jumped up, exclaiming in a voice which showed\
  \ how hope struggled within him, \u201CNo! he is not dead! he can\u2019t be dead!\
  \ It might happen to any one else, but never to him! He could get out of anything!\u201D\
  \ Then his strength forsaking him, \u201COh! I can do no more!\u201D he murmured.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNeb,\u201D said Herbert, running to him, \u201Cwe will find him! God will\
  \ give him back to us! But in the meantime you are hungry, and you must eat something.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>So saying, he offered the poor Negro a few handfuls of shell\u2011fish, which\
  \ was indeed wretched and insufficient food. Neb had not eaten anything for several\
  \ hours, but he refused them. He could not, would not live without his master.</p>"
- "<p>As to Gideon Spilett, he devoured the shell\u2011fish, then he laid himself\
  \ down on the sand, at the foot of a rock. He was very weak, but calm. Herbert went\
  \ up to him, and taking his hand, \u201CSir,\u201D said he, \u201Cwe have found\
  \ a shelter which will be better than lying here. Night is advancing. Come and rest!\
  \ To\u2011morrow we will search farther.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The reporter got up, and guided by the boy went towards the cave. On the way,
  Pencroft asked him in the most natural tone, if by chance he happened to have a
  match or two.</p>
- "<p>The reporter stopped, felt in his pockets, but finding nothing said, \u201C\
  I had some, but I must have thrown them away.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The seaman then put the same question to Neb and received the same answer.</p>
- "<p>\u201CConfound it!\u201D exclaimed the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>The reporter heard him and seizing his arm, \u201CHave you no matches?\u201D\
  \ he asked.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNot one, and no fire in consequence.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh!\u201D cried Neb, \u201Cif my master was here, he would know what to\
  \ do!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The four castaways remained motionless, looking uneasily at each other. Herbert\
  \ was the first to break the silence by saying, \u201CMr. Spilett, you are a smoker\
  \ and always have matches about you; perhaps you haven\u2019t looked well, try again,\
  \ a single match will be enough!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The reporter hunted again in the pockets of his trousers, waistcoat, and great\u2011\
  coat, and at last to Pencroft\u2019s great joy, no less to his extreme surprise,\
  \ he felt a tiny piece of wood entangled in the lining of his waistcoat. He seized\
  \ it with his fingers through the stuff, but he could not get it out. If this was\
  \ a match and a single one, it was of great importance not to rub off the phosphorus.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWill you let me try?\u201D said the boy, and very cleverly, without breaking\
  \ it, he managed to draw out the wretched yet precious little bit of wood which\
  \ was of such great importance to these poor men. It was unused.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHurrah!\u201D cried Pencroft; \u201Cit is as good as having a whole cargo!\u201D\
  \ He took the match, and, followed by his companions, entered the cave.</p>"
- <p>This small piece of wood, of which so many in an inhabited country are wasted
  with indifference and are of no value, must here be used with the greatest caution.</p>
- "<p>The sailor first made sure that it was quite dry; that done, \u201CWe must have\
  \ some paper,\u201D said he.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHere,\u201D replied Spilett, after some hesitation tearing a leaf out\
  \ of his note\u2011book.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft took the piece of paper which the reporter held out to him, and knelt
  down before the fireplace. Some handfuls of grass, leaves, and dry moss were placed
  under the fagots and disposed in such a way that the air could easily circulate,
  and the dry wood would rapidly catch fire.</p>
- <p>Pencroft then twisted the piece of paper into the shape of a cone, as smokers
  do in a high wind, and poked it in among the moss. Taking a small, rough stone,
  he wiped it carefully, and with a beating heart, holding his breath, he gently rubbed
  the match. The first attempt did not produce any effect. Pencroft had not struck
  hard enough, fearing to rub off the phosphorus.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNo, I can\u2019t do it,\u201D said he, \u201Cmy hand trembles, the match\
  \ has missed fire; I cannot, I will not!\u201D and rising, he told Herbert to take\
  \ his place.</p>"
- <p>Certainly the boy had never in all his life been so nervous. Prometheus going
  to steal the fire from heaven could not have been more anxious. He did not hesitate,
  however, but struck the match directly.</p>
- <p>A little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up, making a choking
  smoke. Herbert quickly turned the match so as to augment the flame, and then slipped
  it into the paper cone, which in a few seconds too caught fire, and then the moss.</p>
- <p>A minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame, assisted by the vigorous
  blowing of the sailor, sprang up in the midst of the darkness.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAt last!\u201D cried Pencroft, getting up; \u201CI was never so nervous\
  \ before in all my life!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The flat stones made a capital fireplace. The smoke went quite easily out at
  the narrow passage, the chimney drew, and an agreeable warmth was not long in being
  felt.</p>
- <p>They must now take great care not to let the fire go out, and always to keep
  some embers alight. It only needed care and attention, as they had plenty of wood
  and could renew their store at any time.</p>
- "<p>Pencroft\u2019s first thought was to use the fire by preparing a more nourishing\
  \ supper than a dish of shell\u2011fish. Two dozen eggs were brought by Herbert.\
  \ The reporter leaning up in a corner, watched these preparations without saying\
  \ anything. A threefold thought weighed on his mind. Was Cyrus still alive? If he\
  \ was alive, where was he? If he had survived from his fall, how was it that he\
  \ had not found some means of making known his existence? As to Neb, he was roaming\
  \ about the shore. He was like a body without a soul.</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft knew fifty ways of cooking eggs, but this time he had no choice, and\
  \ was obliged to content himself with roasting them under the hot cinders. In a\
  \ few minutes the cooking was done, and the seaman invited the reporter to take\
  \ his share of the supper. Such was the first repast of the castaways on this unknown\
  \ coast. The hard eggs were excellent, and as eggs contain everything indispensable\
  \ to man\u2019s nourishment, these poor people thought themselves well off, and\
  \ were much strengthened by them. Oh! if only one of them had not been missing at\
  \ this meal! If the five prisoners who escaped from Richmond had been all there,\
  \ under the piled\u2011up rocks, before this clear, crackling fire on the dry sand,\
  \ what thanksgiving must they have rendered to Heaven! But the most ingenious, the\
  \ most learned, he who was their unquestioned chief, Cyrus Harding, was, alas! missing,\
  \ and his body had not even obtained a burial\u2011place.</p>"
- <p>Thus passed the 25th of March. Night had come on. Outside could be heard the
  howling of the wind and the monotonous sound of the surf breaking on the shore.
  The waves rolled the shingle backwards and forwards with a deafening noise.</p>
- <p>The reporter retired into a dark corner after having shortly noted down the occurrences
  of the day; the first appearance of this new land, the loss of their leader, the
  exploration of the coast, the incident of the matches, etc.; and then overcome by
  fatigue, he managed to forget his sorrows in sleep. Herbert went to sleep directly.
  As to the sailor, he passed the night with one eye on the fire, on which he did
  not spare fuel. But one of the castaways did not sleep in the cave. The inconsolable,
  despairing Neb, notwithstanding all that his companions could say to induce him
  to take some rest, wandered all night long on the shore calling on his master.</p>
- <p>Chapter 6</p>
- "<p>The inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from the clouds,\
  \ thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited, was soon made out. They\
  \ had nothing, save the clothes which they were wearing at the time of the catastrophe.\
  \ We must mention, however, a note\u2011book and a watch which Gideon Spilett had\
  \ kept, doubtless by inadvertence, not a weapon, not a tool, not even a pocket\u2011\
  knife; for while in the car they had thrown out everything to lighten the balloon.\
  \ The imaginary heroes of Daniel Defoe or of Wyss, as well as Selkirk and Raynal\
  \ shipwrecked on Juan Fernandez and on the archipelago of the Aucklands, were never\
  \ in such absolute destitution. Either they had abundant resources from their stranded\
  \ vessels, in grain, cattle, tools, ammunition, or else some things were thrown\
  \ up on the coast which supplied them with all the first necessities of life. But\
  \ here, not any instrument whatever, not a utensil. From nothing they must supply\
  \ themselves with everything.</p>"
- <p>And yet, if Cyrus Harding had been with them, if the engineer could have brought
  his practical science, his inventive mind to bear on their situation, perhaps all
  hope would not have been lost. Alas! they must hope no longer again to see Cyrus
  Harding. The castaways could expect nothing but from themselves and from that Providence
  which never abandons those whose faith is sincere.</p>
- <p>But ought they to establish themselves on this part of the coast, without trying
  to know to what continent it belonged, if it was inhabited, or if they were on the
  shore of a desert island?</p>
- "<p>It was an important question, and should be solved with the shortest possible\
  \ delay. From its answer they would know what measures to take. However, according\
  \ to Pencroft\u2019s advice, it appeared best to wait a few days before commencing\
  \ an exploration. They must, in fact, prepare some provisions and procure more strengthening\
  \ food than eggs and molluscs. The explorers, before undertaking new fatigues, must\
  \ first of all recruit their strength.</p>"
- "<p>The Chimneys offered a retreat sufficient for the present. The fire was lighted,\
  \ and it was easy to preserve some embers. There were plenty of shell\u2011fish\
  \ and eggs among the rocks and on the beach. It would be easy to kill a few of the\
  \ pigeons which were flying by hundreds about the summit of the plateau, either\
  \ with sticks or stones. Perhaps the trees of the neighboring forest would supply\
  \ them with eatable fruit. Lastly, the sweet water was there.</p>"
- <p>It was accordingly settled that for a few days they would remain at the Chimneys
  so as to prepare themselves for an expedition, either along the shore or into the
  interior of the country. This plan suited Neb particularly. As obstinate in his
  ideas as in his presentiments, he was in no haste to abandon this part of the coast,
  the scene of the catastrophe. He did not, he would not believe in the loss of Cyrus
  Harding. No, it did not seem to him possible that such a man had ended in this vulgar
  fashion, carried away by a wave, drowned in the floods, a few hundred feet from
  a shore. As long as the waves had not cast up the body of the engineer, as long
  as he, Neb, had not seen with his eyes, touched with his hands the corpse of his
  master, he would not believe in his death! And this idea rooted itself deeper than
  ever in his determined heart. An illusion perhaps, but still an illusion to be respected,
  and one which the sailor did not wish to destroy. As for him, he hoped no longer,
  but there was no use in arguing with Neb. He was like the dog who will not leave
  the place where his master is buried, and his grief was such that most probably
  he would not survive him.</p>
- <p>This same morning, the 26th of March, at daybreak, Neb had set out on the shore
  in a northerly direction, and he had returned to the spot where the sea, no doubt,
  had closed over the unfortunate Harding.</p>
- "<p>That day\u2019s breakfast was composed solely of pigeon\u2019s eggs and lithodomes.\
  \ Herbert had found some salt deposited by evaporation in the hollows of the rocks,\
  \ and this mineral was very welcome.</p>"
- <p>The repast ended, Pencroft asked the reporter if he wished to accompany Herbert
  and himself to the forest, where they were going to try to hunt. But on consideration,
  it was thought necessary that someone should remain to keep in the fire, and to
  be at hand in the highly improbable event of Neb requiring aid. The reporter accordingly
  remained behind.</p>
- "<p>\u201CTo the chase, Herbert,\u201D said the sailor. \u201CWe shall find ammunition\
  \ on our way, and cut our weapons in the forest.\u201D But at the moment of starting,\
  \ Herbert observed, that since they had no tinder, it would perhaps be prudent to\
  \ replace it by another substance.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBurnt linen,\u201D replied the boy. \u201CThat could in case of need serve\
  \ for tinder.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The sailor thought it very sensible advice. Only it had the inconvenience of\
  \ necessitating the sacrifice of a piece of handkerchief. Notwithstanding, the thing\
  \ was well worth while trying, and a part of Pencroft\u2019s large checked handkerchief\
  \ was soon reduced to the state of a half\u2011burnt rag. This inflammable material\
  \ was placed in the central chamber at the bottom of a little cavity in the rock,\
  \ sheltered from all wind and damp.</p>"
- "<p>It was nine o\u2019clock in the morning. The weather was threatening and the\
  \ breeze blew from the southeast. Herbert and Pencroft turned the angle of the Chimneys,\
  \ not without having cast a look at the smoke which, just at that place, curled\
  \ round a point of rock: they ascended the left bank of the river.</p>"
- <p>Arrived at the forest, Pencroft broke from the first tree two stout branches
  which he transformed into clubs, the ends of which Herbert rubbed smooth on a rock.
  Oh! what would they not have given for a knife!</p>
- '<p>The two hunters now advanced among the long grass, following the bank. From
  the turning which directed its course to the southwest, the river narrowed gradually
  and the channel lay between high banks, over which the trees formed a double arch.
  Pencroft, lest they should lose themselves, resolved to follow the course of the
  stream, which would always lead them back to the point from which they started.
  But the bank was not without some obstacles: here, the flexible branches of the
  trees bent level with the current; there, creepers and thorns which they had to
  break down with their sticks. Herbert often glided among the broken stumps with
  the agility of a young cat, and disappeared in the underwood. But Pencroft called
  him back directly, begging him not to wander away. Meanwhile, the sailor attentively
  observed the disposition and nature of the surrounding country. On the left bank,
  the ground, which was flat and marshy, rose imperceptibly towards the interior.
  It looked there like a network of liquid threads which doubtless reached the river
  by some underground drain. Sometimes a stream ran through the underwood, which they
  crossed without difficulty. The opposite shore appeared to be more uneven, and the
  valley of which the river occupied the bottom was more clearly visible. The hill,
  covered with trees disposed in terraces, intercepted the view. On the right bank
  walking would have been difficult, for the declivities fell suddenly, and the trees
  bending over the water were only sustained by the strength of their roots.</p>'
- "<p>It is needless to add that this forest, as well as the coast already surveyed,\
  \ was destitute of any sign of human life. Pencroft only saw traces of quadrupeds,\
  \ fresh footprints of animals, of which he could not recognize the species. In all\
  \ probability, and such was also Herbert\u2019s opinion, some had been left by formidable\
  \ wild beasts which doubtless would give them some trouble; but nowhere did they\
  \ observe the mark of an axe on the trees, nor the ashes of a fire, nor the impression\
  \ of a human foot. On this they might probably congratulate themselves, for on any\
  \ land in the middle of the Pacific the presence of man was perhaps more to be feared\
  \ than desired. Herbert and Pencroft speaking little, for the difficulties of the\
  \ way were great, advanced very slowly, and after walking for an hour they had scarcely\
  \ gone more than a mile. As yet the hunt had not been successful. However, some\
  \ birds sang and fluttered in the foliage, and appeared very timid, as if man had\
  \ inspired them with an instinctive fear. Among others, Herbert described, in a\
  \ marshy part of the forest, a bird with a long pointed beak, closely resembling\
  \ the king\u2011fisher, but its plumage was not fine, though of a metallic brilliancy.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat must be a jacamar,\u201D said Herbert, trying to get nearer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis will be a good opportunity to taste jacamar,\u201D replied the sailor,\
  \ \u201Cif that fellow is in a humor to be roasted!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Just then, a stone cleverly thrown by the boy, struck the creature on the wing,
  but the blow did not disable it, and the jacamar ran off and disappeared in an instant.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHow clumsy I am!\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, no, my boy!\u201D replied the sailor. \u201CThe blow was well aimed;\
  \ many a one would have missed it altogether! Come, don\u2019t be vexed with yourself.\
  \ We shall catch it another day!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>As the hunters advanced, the trees were found to be more scattered, many being\
  \ magnificent, but none bore eatable fruit. Pencroft searched in vain for some of\
  \ those precious palm\u2011trees which are employed in so many ways in domestic\
  \ life, and which have been found as far as the fortieth parallel in the Northern\
  \ Hemisphere, and to the thirty\u2011fifth only in the Southern Hemisphere. But\
  \ this forest was only composed of coniferae, such as deodaras, already recognized\
  \ by Herbert, and Douglas pine, similar to those which grow on the northwest coast\
  \ of America, and splendid firs, measuring a hundred and fifty feet in height.</p>"
- <p>At this moment a flock of birds, of a small size and pretty plumage, with long
  glancing tails, dispersed themselves among the branches strewing their feathers,
  which covered the ground as with fine down. Herbert picked up a few of these feathers,
  and after having examined them,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CThese are couroucous,\u201D said he.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI should prefer a moor\u2011cock or guinea\u2011fowl,\u201D replied Pencroft,\
  \ \u201Cstill, if they are good to eat?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey are good to eat, and also their flesh is very delicate,\u201D replied\
  \ Herbert. \u201CBesides, if I don\u2019t mistake, it is easy to approach and kill\
  \ them with a stick.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The sailor and the lad, creeping among the grass, arrived at the foot of a tree,
  whose lower branches were covered with little birds. The couroucous were waiting
  the passage of insects which served for their nourishment. Their feathery feet could
  be seen clasping the slender twigs which supported them.</p>
- <p>The hunters then rose, and using their sticks like scythes, they mowed down whole
  rows of these couroucous, who never thought of flying away, and stupidly allowed
  themselves to be knocked off. A hundred were already heaped on the ground, before
  the others made up their minds to fly.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Chere is game, which is quite within the\
  \ reach of hunters like us. We have only to put out our hands and take it!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The sailor having strung the couroucous like larks on flexible twigs, they then
  continued their exploration. The stream here made a bend towards the south, but
  this detour was probably not prolonged for the river must have its source in the
  mountain, and be supplied by the melting of the snow which covered the sides of
  the central cone.</p>
- "<p>The particular object of their expedition was, as has been said, to procure\
  \ the greatest possible quantity of game for the inhabitants of the Chimneys. It\
  \ must be acknowledged that as yet this object had not been attained. So the sailor\
  \ actively pursued his researches, though he exclaimed, when some animal which he\
  \ had not even time to recognize fled into the long grass, \u201CIf only we had\
  \ had the dog Top!\u201D But Top had disappeared at the same time as his master,\
  \ and had probably perished with him.</p>"
- "<p>Towards three o\u2019clock new flocks of birds were seen through certain trees,\
  \ at whose aromatic berries they were pecking, those of the juniper\u2011tree among\
  \ others. Suddenly a loud trumpet call resounded through the forest. This strange\
  \ and sonorous cry was produced by a game bird called grouse in the United States.\
  \ They soon saw several couples, whose plumage was rich chestnut\u2011brown mottled\
  \ with dark brown, and tail of the same color. Herbert recognized the males by the\
  \ two wing\u2011like appendages raised on the neck. Pencroft determined to get hold\
  \ of at least one of these gallinaceae, which were as large as a fowl, and whose\
  \ flesh is better than that of a pullet. But it was difficult, for they would not\
  \ allow themselves to be approached. After several fruitless attempts, which resulted\
  \ in nothing but scaring the grouse, the sailor said to the lad,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDecidedly, since we can\u2019t kill them on the wing, we must try to take\
  \ them with a line.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLike a fish?\u201D cried Herbert, much surprised at the proposal.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLike a fish,\u201D replied the sailor quite seriously. Pencroft had found\
  \ among the grass half a dozen grouse nests, each having three or four eggs. He\
  \ took great care not to touch these nests, to which their proprietors would not\
  \ fail to return. It was around these that he meant to stretch his lines, not snares,\
  \ but real fishing\u2011lines. He took Herbert to some distance from the nests,\
  \ and there prepared his singular apparatus with all the care which a disciple of\
  \ Izaak Walton would have used. Herbert watched the work with great interest, though\
  \ rather doubting its success. The lines were made of fine creepers, fastened one\
  \ to the other, of the length of fifteen or twenty feet. Thick, strong thorns, the\
  \ points bent back (which were supplied from a dwarf acacia bush) were fastened\
  \ to the ends of the creepers, by way of hooks. Large red worms, which were crawling\
  \ on the ground, furnished bait.</p>"
- <p>This done, Pencroft, passing among the grass and concealing himself skillfully,
  placed the end of his lines armed with hooks near the grouse nests; then he returned,
  took the other ends and hid with Herbert behind a large tree. There they both waited
  patiently; though, it must be said, that Herbert did not reckon much on the success
  of the inventive Pencroft.</p>
- "<p>A whole half\u2011hour passed, but then, as the sailor had surmised, several\
  \ couple of grouse returned to their nests. They walked along, pecking the ground,\
  \ and not suspecting in any way the presence of the hunters, who, besides, had taken\
  \ care to place themselves to leeward of the gallinaceae.</p>"
- <p>The lad felt at this moment highly interested. He held his breath, and Pencroft,
  his eyes staring, his mouth open, his lips advanced, as if about to taste a piece
  of grouse, scarcely breathed.</p>
- <p>Meanwhile, the birds walked about the hooks, without taking any notice of them.
  Pencroft then gave little tugs which moved the bait as if the worms had been still
  alive.</p>
- "<p>The sailor undoubtedly felt much greater anxiety than does the fisherman, for\
  \ he does not see his prey coming through the water. The jerks attracted the attention\
  \ of the gallinaceae, and they attacked the hooks with their beaks. Three voracious\
  \ grouse swallowed at the same moment bait and hook. Suddenly with a smart jerk,\
  \ Pencroft \u201Cstruck\u201D his line, and a flapping of wings showed that the\
  \ birds were taken.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHurrah!\u201D he cried, rushing towards the game, of which he made himself\
  \ master in an instant.</p>"
- <p>Herbert clapped his hands. It was the first time that he had ever seen birds
  taken with a line, but the sailor modestly confessed that it was not his first attempt,
  and that besides he could not claim the merit of invention.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAnd at any rate,\u201D added he, \u201Csituated as we are, we must hope\
  \ to hit upon many other contrivances.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The grouse were fastened by their claws, and Pencroft, delighted at not having
  to appear before their companions with empty hands, and observing that the day had
  begun to decline, judged it best to return to their dwelling.</p>
- "<p>The direction was indicated by the river, whose course they had only to follow,\
  \ and, towards six o\u2019clock, tired enough with their excursion, Herbert and\
  \ Pencroft arrived at the Chimneys.</p>"
- <p>Chapter 7</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett was standing motionless on the shore, his arms crossed, gazing
  over the sea, the horizon of which was lost towards the east in a thick black cloud
  which was spreading rapidly towards the zenith. The wind was already strong, and
  increased with the decline of day. The whole sky was of a threatening aspect, and
  the first symptoms of a violent storm were clearly visible.</p>
- <p>Herbert entered the Chimneys, and Pencroft went towards the reporter. The latter,
  deeply absorbed, did not see him approach.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe are going to have a dirty night, Mr. Spilett!\u201D said the sailor:\
  \ \u201CPetrels delight in wind and rain.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The reporter, turning at the moment, saw Pencroft, and his first words were,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CAt what distance from the coast would you say the car was, when the waves\
  \ carried off our companion?\u201D</p>"
- <p>The sailor had not expected this question. He reflected an instant and replied,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CTwo cables lengths at the most.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut what is a cable\u2019s length?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAbout a hundred and twenty fathoms, or six hundred feet.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen,\u201D said the reporter, \u201CCyrus Harding must have disappeared\
  \ twelve hundred feet at the most from the shore?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAbout that,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd his dog also?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAlso.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat astonishes me,\u201D rejoined the reporter, \u201Cwhile admitting\
  \ that our companion has perished, is that Top has also met his death, and that\
  \ neither the body of the dog nor of his master has been cast on the shore!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is not astonishing, with such a heavy sea,\u201D replied the sailor.\
  \ \u201CBesides, it is possible that currents have carried them farther down the\
  \ coast.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?\u201D\
  \ again asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is my opinion.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy own opinion,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cwith due deference to\
  \ your experience, Pencroft, is that in the double fact of the absolute disappearance\
  \ of Cyrus and Top, living or dead, there is something unaccountable and unlikely.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CI wish I could think like you, Mr. Spilett,\u201D replied Pencroft; \u201C\
  unhappily, my mind is made up on this point.\u201D Having said this, the sailor\
  \ returned to the Chimneys. A good fire crackled on the hearth. Herbert had just\
  \ thrown on an armful of dry wood, and the flame cast a bright light into the darkest\
  \ parts of the passage.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft immediately began to prepare the dinner. It appeared best to introduce
  something solid into the bill of fare, for all needed to get up their strength.
  The strings of couroucous were kept for the next day, but they plucked a couple
  of grouse, which were soon spitted on a stick, and roasting before a blazing fire.</p>
- "<p>At seven in the evening Neb had not returned. The prolonged absence of the Negro\
  \ made Pencroft very uneasy. It was to be feared that he had met with an accident\
  \ on this unknown land, or that the unhappy fellow had been driven to some act of\
  \ despair. But Herbert drew very different conclusions from this absence. According\
  \ to him, Neb\u2019s delay was caused by some new circumstances which had induced\
  \ him to prolong his search. Also, everything new must be to the advantage of Cyrus\
  \ Harding. Why had Neb not returned unless hope still detained him? Perhaps he had\
  \ found some mark, a footstep, a trace which had put him in the right path. Perhaps\
  \ he was at this moment on a certain track. Perhaps even he was near his master.</p>"
- <p>Thus the lad reasoned. Thus he spoke. His companions let him talk. The reporter
  alone approved with a gesture. But what Pencroft thought most probable was, that
  Neb had pushed his researches on the shore farther than the day before, and that
  he had not as yet had time to return.</p>
- <p>Herbert, however, agitated by vague presentiments, several times manifested an
  intention to go to meet Neb. But Pencroft assured him that that would be a useless
  course, that in the darkness and deplorable weather he could not find any traces
  of Neb, and that it would be much better to wait. If Neb had not made his appearance
  by the next day, Pencroft would not hesitate to join him in his search.</p>
- "<p>Gideon Spilett approved of the sailor\u2019s opinion that it was best not to\
  \ divide, and Herbert was obliged to give up his project; but two large tears fell\
  \ from his eyes.</p>"
- <p>The reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous boy.</p>
- "<p>Bad weather now set in. A furious gale from the southeast passed over the coast.\
  \ The sea roared as it beat over the reef. Heavy rain was dashed by the storm into\
  \ particles like dust. Ragged masses of vapor drove along the beach, on which the\
  \ tormented shingles sounded as if poured out in cart\u2011loads, while the sand\
  \ raised by the wind added as it were mineral dust to that which was liquid, and\
  \ rendered the united attack insupportable. Between the river\u2019s mouth and the\
  \ end of the cliff, eddies of wind whirled and gusts from this maelstrom lashed\
  \ the water which ran through the narrow valley. The smoke from the fireplace was\
  \ also driven back through the opening, filling the passages and rendering them\
  \ uninhabitable.</p>"
- <p>Therefore, as the grouse were cooked, Pencroft let the fire die away, and only
  preserved a few embers buried under the ashes.</p>
- "<p>At eight o\u2019clock Neb had not appeared, but there was no doubt that the\
  \ frightful weather alone hindered his return, and that he must have taken refuge\
  \ in some cave, to await the end of the storm or at least the return of day. As\
  \ to going to meet him, or attempting to find him, it was impossible.</p>"
- <p>The game constituted the only dish at supper; the meat was excellent, and Pencroft
  and Herbert, whose long excursion had rendered them very hungry, devoured it with
  infinite satisfaction.</p>
- <p>Their meal concluded, each retired to the corner in which he had rested the preceding
  night, and Herbert was not long in going to sleep near the sailor, who had stretched
  himself beside the fireplace.</p>
- <p>Outside, as the night advanced, the tempest also increased in strength, until
  it was equal to that which had carried the prisoners from Richmond to this land
  in the Pacific. The tempests which are frequent during the seasons of the equinox,
  and which are so prolific in catastrophes, are above all terrible over this immense
  ocean, which opposes no obstacle to their fury. No description can give an idea
  of the terrific violence of the gale as it beat upon the unprotected coast.</p>
- <p>Happily the pile of rocks which formed the Chimneys was solid. It was composed
  of enormous blocks of granite, a few of which, insecurely balanced, seemed to tremble
  on their foundations, and Pencroft could feel rapid quiverings under his head as
  it rested on the rock. But he repeated to himself, and rightly, that there was nothing
  to fear, and that their retreat would not give way. However he heard the noise of
  stones torn from the summit of the plateau by the wind, falling down on to the beach.
  A few even rolled on to the upper part of the Chimneys, or flew off in fragments
  when they were projected perpendicularly. Twice the sailor rose and intrenched himself
  at the opening of the passage, so as to take a look in safety at the outside. But
  there was nothing to be feared from these showers, which were not considerable,
  and he returned to his couch before the fireplace, where the embers glowed beneath
  the ashes.</p>
- <p>Notwithstanding the fury of the hurricane, the uproar of the tempest, the thunder,
  and the tumult, Herbert slept profoundly. Sleep at last took possession of Pencroft,
  whom a seafaring life had habituated to anything. Gideon Spilett alone was kept
  awake by anxiety. He reproached himself with not having accompanied Neb. It was
  evident that he had not abandoned all hope. The presentiments which had troubled
  Herbert did not cease to agitate him also. His thoughts were concentrated on Neb.
  Why had Neb not returned? He tossed about on his sandy couch, scarcely giving a
  thought to the struggle of the elements. Now and then, his eyes, heavy with fatigue,
  closed for an instant, but some sudden thought reopened them almost immediately.</p>
- <p>Meanwhile the night advanced, and it was perhaps two hours from morning, when
  Pencroft, then sound asleep, was vigorously shaken.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201D he cried, rousing himself, and collecting\
  \ his ideas with the promptitude usual to seamen.</p>"
- <p>The reporter was leaning over him, and saying,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CListen, Pencroft, listen!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The sailor strained his ears, but could hear no noise beyond those caused by
  the storm.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is the wind,\u201D said he.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, listening again, \u201CI thought I heard?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe barking of a dog!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA dog!\u201D cried Pencroft, springing up.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes?barking?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt\u2019s not possible!\u201D replied the sailor. \u201CAnd besides, how,\
  \ in the roaring of the storm?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CStop?listen?\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft listened more attentively, and really thought he heard, during a lull,
  distant barking.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell!\u201D said the reporter, pressing the sailor\u2019s hand.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes?yes!\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is Top! It is Top!\u201D cried Herbert, who had just awoke; and all\
  \ three rushed towards the opening of the Chimneys. They had great difficulty in\
  \ getting out. The wind drove them back. But at last they succeeded, and could only\
  \ remain standing by leaning against the rocks. They looked about, but could not\
  \ speak. The darkness was intense. The sea, the sky, the land were all mingled in\
  \ one black mass. Not a speck of light was visible.</p>"
- <p>The reporter and his companions remained thus for a few minutes, overwhelmed
  by the wind, drenched by the rain, blinded by the sand.</p>
- <p>Then, in a pause of the tumult, they again heard the barking, which they found
  must be at some distance.</p>
- "<p>It could only be Top! But was he alone or accompanied? He was most probably\
  \ alone, for, if Neb had been with him, he would have made his way more directly\
  \ towards the Chimneys. The sailor squeezed the reporter\u2019s hand, for he could\
  \ not make himself heard, in a way which signified \u201CWait!\u201D then he reentered\
  \ the passage.</p>"
- <p>An instant after he issued with a lighted fagot, which he threw into the darkness,
  whistling shrilly.</p>
- <p>It appeared as if this signal had been waited for; the barking immediately came
  nearer, and soon a dog bounded into the passage. Pencroft, Herbert, and Spilett
  entered after him.</p>
- <p>An armful of dry wood was thrown on the embers. The passage was lighted up with
  a bright flame.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is Top!\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>It was indeed Top, a magnificent Anglo\u2011Norman, who derived from these two\
  \ races crossed the swiftness of foot and the acuteness of smell which are the preeminent\
  \ qualities of coursing dogs. It was the dog of the engineer, Cyrus Harding. But\
  \ he was alone! Neither Neb nor his master accompanied him!</p>"
- "<p>How was it that his instinct had guided him straight to the Chimneys, which\
  \ he did not know? It appeared inexplicable, above all, in the midst of this black\
  \ night and in such a tempest! But what was still more inexplicable was, that Top\
  \ was neither tired, nor exhausted, nor even soiled with mud or sand!?Herbert had\
  \ drawn him towards him, and was patting his head, the dog rubbing his neck against\
  \ the lad\u2019s hands.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf the dog is found, the master will be found also!\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGod grant it!\u201D responded Herbert. \u201CLet us set off! Top will\
  \ guide us!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft did not make any objection. He felt that Top\u2019s arrival contradicted\
  \ his conjectures. \u201CCome along then!\u201D said he.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft carefully covered the embers on the hearth. He placed a few pieces of
  wood among them, so as to keep in the fire until their return. Then, preceded by
  the dog, who seemed to invite them by short barks to come with him, and followed
  by the reporter and the boy, he dashed out, after having put up in his handkerchief
  the remains of the supper.</p>
- "<p>The storm was then in all its violence, and perhaps at its height. Not a single\
  \ ray of light from the moon pierced through the clouds. To follow a straight course\
  \ was difficult. It was best to rely on Top\u2019s instinct. They did so. The reporter\
  \ and Herbert walked behind the dog, and the sailor brought up the rear. It was\
  \ impossible to exchange a word. The rain was not very heavy, but the wind was terrific.</p>"
- <p>However, one circumstance favored the seaman and his two companions. The wind
  being southeast, consequently blew on their backs. The clouds of sand, which otherwise
  would have been insupportable, from being received behind, did not in consequence
  impede their progress. In short, they sometimes went faster than they liked, and
  had some difficulty in keeping their feet; but hope gave them strength, for it was
  not at random that they made their way along the shore. They had no doubt that Neb
  had found his master, and that he had sent them the faithful dog. But was the engineer
  living, or had Neb only sent for his companions that they might render the last
  duties to the corpse of the unfortunate Harding?</p>
- <p>After having passed the precipice, Herbert, the reporter, and Pencroft prudently
  stepped aside to stop and take breath. The turn of the rocks sheltered them from
  the wind, and they could breathe after this walk or rather run of a quarter of an
  hour.</p>
- <p>They could now hear and reply to each other, and the lad having pronounced the
  name of Cyrus Harding, Top gave a few short barks, as much as to say that his master
  was saved.</p>
- "<p>\u201CSaved, isn\u2019t he?\u201D repeated Herbert; \u201Csaved, Top?\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>And the dog barked in reply.</p>
- <p>They once more set out. The tide began to rise, and urged by the wind it threatened
  to be unusually high, as it was a spring tide. Great billows thundered against the
  reef with such violence that they probably passed entirely over the islet, then
  quite invisible. The mole no longer protected the coast, which was directly exposed
  to the attacks of the open sea.</p>
- <p>As soon as the sailor and his companions left the precipice, the wind struck
  them again with renewed fury. Though bent under the gale they walked very quickly,
  following Top, who did not hesitate as to what direction to take.</p>
- <p>They ascended towards the north, having on their left an interminable extent
  of billows, which broke with a deafening noise, and on their right a dark country,
  the aspect of which it was impossible to guess. But they felt that it was comparatively
  flat, for the wind passed completely over them, without being driven back as it
  was when it came in contact with the cliff.</p>
- "<p>At four o\u2019clock in the morning, they reckoned that they had cleared about\
  \ five miles. The clouds were slightly raised, and the wind, though less damp, was\
  \ very sharp and cold. Insufficiently protected by their clothing, Pencroft, Herbert\
  \ and Spilett suffered cruelly, but not a complaint escaped their lips. They were\
  \ determined to follow Top, wherever the intelligent animal wished to lead them.</p>"
- "<p>Towards five o\u2019clock day began to break. At the zenith, where the fog was\
  \ less thick, gray shades bordered the clouds; under an opaque belt, a luminous\
  \ line clearly traced the horizon. The crests of the billows were tipped with a\
  \ wild light, and the foam regained its whiteness. At the same time on the left\
  \ the hilly parts of the coast could be seen, though very indistinctly.</p>"
- "<p>At six o\u2019clock day had broken. The clouds rapidly lifted. The seaman and\
  \ his companions were then about six miles from the Chimneys. They were following\
  \ a very flat shore bounded by a reef of rocks, whose heads scarcely emerged from\
  \ the sea, for they were in deep water. On the left, the country appeared to be\
  \ one vast extent of sandy downs, bristling with thistles. There was no cliff, and\
  \ the shore offered no resistance to the ocean but a chain of irregular hillocks.\
  \ Here and there grew two or three trees, inclined towards the west, their branches\
  \ projecting in that direction. Quite behind, in the southwest, extended the border\
  \ of the forest.</p>"
- <p>At this moment, Top became very excited. He ran forward, then returned, and seemed
  to entreat them to hasten their steps. The dog then left the beach, and guided by
  his wonderful instinct, without showing the least hesitation, went straight in among
  the downs. They followed him. The country appeared an absolute desert. Not a living
  creature was to be seen.</p>
- <p>The downs, the extent of which was large, were composed of hillocks and even
  of hills, very irregularly distributed. They resembled a Switzerland modeled in
  sand, and only an amazing instinct could have possibly recognized the way.</p>
- <p>Five minutes after having left the beach, the reporter and his two companions
  arrived at a sort of excavation, hollowed out at the back of a high mound. There
  Top stopped, and gave a loud, clear bark. Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft dashed
  into the cave.</p>
- <p>Neb was there, kneeling beside a body extended on a bed of grass.</p>
- <p>The body was that of the engineer, Cyrus Harding.</p>
- <p>Chapter 8</p>
- <p>Neb did not move. Pencroft only uttered one word.</p>
- "<p>\u201CLiving?\u201D he cried.</p>"
- <p>Neb did not reply. Spilett and the sailor turned pale. Herbert clasped his hands,
  and remained motionless. The poor Negro, absorbed in his grief, evidently had neither
  seen his companions nor heard the sailor speak.</p>
- "<p>The reporter knelt down beside the motionless body, and placed his ear to the\
  \ engineer\u2019s chest, having first torn open his clothes.</p>"
- <p>A minute?an age!?passed, during which he endeavored to catch the faintest throb
  of the heart.</p>
- <p>Neb had raised himself a little and gazed without seeing. Despair had completely
  changed his countenance. He could scarcely be recognized, exhausted with fatigue,
  broken with grief. He believed his master was dead.</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett at last rose, after a long and attentive examination.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHe lives!\u201D said he.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft knelt in his turn beside the engineer, he also heard a throbbing, and
  even felt a slight breath on his cheek.</p>
- <p>Herbert at a word from the reporter ran out to look for water. He found, a hundred
  feet off, a limpid stream, which seemed to have been greatly increased by the rains,
  and which filtered through the sand; but nothing in which to put the water, not
  even a shell among the downs. The lad was obliged to content himself with dipping
  his handkerchief in the stream, and with it hastened back to the grotto.</p>
- "<p>Happily the wet handkerchief was enough for Gideon Spilett, who only wished\
  \ to wet the engineer\u2019s lips. The cold water produced an almost immediate effect.\
  \ His chest heaved and he seemed to try to speak.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe will save him!\u201D exclaimed the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>At these words hope revived in Neb\u2019s heart. He undressed his master to\
  \ see if he was wounded, but not so much as a bruise was to be found, either on\
  \ the head, body, or limbs, which was surprising, as he must have been dashed against\
  \ the rocks; even the hands were uninjured, and it was difficult to explain how\
  \ the engineer showed no traces of the efforts which he must have made to get out\
  \ of reach of the breakers.</p>"
- "<p>But the explanation would come later. When Cyrus was able to speak he would\
  \ say what had happened. For the present the question was, how to recall him to\
  \ life, and it appeared likely that rubbing would bring this about; so they set\
  \ to work with the sailor\u2019s jersey.</p>"
- <p>The engineer, revived by this rude shampooing, moved his arm slightly and began
  to breathe more regularly. He was sinking from exhaustion, and certainly, had not
  the reporter and his companions arrived, it would have been all over with Cyrus
  Harding.</p>
- "<p>\u201CYou thought your master was dead, didn\u2019t you?\u201D said the seaman\
  \ to Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes! quite dead!\u201D replied Neb, \u201Cand if Top had not found you,\
  \ and brought you here, I should have buried my master, and then have lain down\
  \ on his grave to die!\u201D</p>"
- <p>It had indeed been a narrow escape for Cyrus Harding!</p>
- <p>Neb then recounted what had happened. The day before, after having left the Chimneys
  at daybreak, he had ascended the coast in a northerly direction, and had reached
  that part of the shore which he had already visited.</p>
- <p>There, without any hope he acknowledged, Neb had searched the beach, among the
  rocks, on the sand, for the smallest trace to guide him. He examined particularly
  that part of the beach which was not covered by the high tide, for near the sea
  the water would have obliterated all marks. Neb did not expect to find his master
  living. It was for a corpse that he searched, a corpse which he wished to bury with
  his own hands!</p>
- "<p>He sought long in vain. This desert coast appeared never to have been visited\
  \ by a human creature. The shells, those which the sea had not reached, and which\
  \ might be met with by millions above high\u2011water mark, were untouched. Not\
  \ a shell was broken.</p>"
- <p>Neb then resolved to walk along the beach for some miles. It was possible that
  the waves had carried the body to quite a distant point. When a corpse floats a
  little distance from a low shore, it rarely happens that the tide does not throw
  it up, sooner or later. This Neb knew, and he wished to see his master again for
  the last time.</p>
- "<p>\u201CI went along the coast for another two miles, carefully examining the\
  \ beach, both at high and low water, and I had despaired of finding anything, when\
  \ yesterday, above five in the evening, I saw footprints on the sand.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFootprints?\u201D exclaimed Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes!\u201D replied Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDid these footprints begin at the water\u2019s edge?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Neb, \u201Conly above high\u2011water mark, for the\
  \ others must have been washed out by the tide.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGo on, Neb,\u201D said Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI went half crazy when I saw these footprints. They were very clear and\
  \ went towards the downs. I followed them for a quarter of a mile, running, but\
  \ taking care not to destroy them. Five minutes after, as it was getting dark, I\
  \ heard the barking of a dog. It was Top, and Top brought me here, to my master!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Neb ended his account by saying what had been his grief at finding the inanimate
  body, in which he vainly sought for the least sign of life. Now that he had found
  him dead he longed for him to be alive. All his efforts were useless! Nothing remained
  to be done but to render the last duties to the one whom he had loved so much! Neb
  then thought of his companions. They, no doubt, would wish to see the unfortunate
  man again. Top was there. Could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal?
  Neb several times pronounced the name of the reporter, the one among his companions
  whom Top knew best.</p>
- <p>Then he pointed to the south, and the dog bounded off in the direction indicated
  to him.</p>
- <p>We have heard how, guided by an instinct which might be looked upon almost as
  supernatural, Top had found them.</p>
- "<p>Neb\u2019s companions had listened with great attention to this account.</p>"
- <p>It was unaccountable to them how Cyrus Harding, after the efforts which he must
  have made to escape from the waves by crossing the rocks, had not received even
  a scratch. And what could not be explained either was how the engineer had managed
  to get to this cave in the downs, more than a mile from the shore.</p>
- "<p>\u201CSo, Neb,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cit was not you who brought your\
  \ master to this place.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, it was not I,\u201D replied the Negro.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt\u2019s very clear that the captain came here by himself,\u201D said\
  \ Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is clear in reality,\u201D observed Spilett, \u201Cbut it is not credible!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>The explanation of this fact could only be produced from the engineer\u2019\
  s own lips, and they must wait for that till speech returned. Rubbing had re\u2011\
  established the circulation of the blood. Cyrus Harding moved his arm again, then\
  \ his head, and a few incomprehensible words escaped him.</p>"
- <p>Neb, who was bending over him, spoke, but the engineer did not appear to hear,
  and his eyes remained closed. Life was only exhibited in him by movement, his senses
  had not as yet been restored.</p>
- "<p>Pencroft much regretted not having either fire, or the means of procuring it,\
  \ for he had, unfortunately, forgotten to bring the burnt linen, which would easily\
  \ have ignited from the sparks produced by striking together two flints. As to the\
  \ engineer\u2019s pockets, they were entirely empty, except that of his waistcoat,\
  \ which contained his watch. It was necessary to carry Harding to the Chimneys,\
  \ and that as soon as possible. This was the opinion of all.</p>"
- "<p>Meanwhile, the care which was lavished on the engineer brought him back to consciousness\
  \ sooner than they could have expected. The water with which they wetted his lips\
  \ revived him gradually. Pencroft also thought of mixing with the water some moisture\
  \ from the titra\u2019s flesh which he had brought. Herbert ran to the beach and\
  \ returned with two large bivalve shells. The sailor concocted something which he\
  \ introduced between the lips of the engineer, who eagerly drinking it opened his\
  \ eyes.</p>"
- <p>Neb and the reporter were leaning over him.</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy master! my master!\u201D cried Neb.</p>"
- <p>The engineer heard him. He recognized Neb and Spilett, then his other two companions,
  and his hand slightly pressed theirs.</p>
- <p>A few words again escaped him, which showed what thoughts were, even then, troubling
  his brain. This time he was understood. Undoubtedly they were the same words he
  had before attempted to utter.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIsland or continent?\u201D he murmured.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBother the continent,\u201D cried Pencroft hastily; \u201Cthere is time\
  \ enough to see about that, captain! we don\u2019t care for anything, provided you\
  \ are living.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The engineer nodded faintly, and then appeared to sleep.</p>
- <p>They respected this sleep, and the reporter began immediately to make arrangements
  for transporting Harding to a more comfortable place. Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft
  left the cave and directed their steps towards a high mound crowned with a few distorted
  trees. On the way the sailor could not help repeating,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CIsland or continent! To think of that, when at one\u2019s last gasp! What\
  \ a man!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Arrived at the summit of the mound, Pencroft and his two companions set to work,
  with no other tools than their hands, to despoil of its principal branches a rather
  sickly tree, a sort of marine fir; with these branches they made a litter, on which,
  covered with grass and leaves, they could carry the engineer.</p>
- "<p>This occupied them nearly forty minutes, and it was ten o\u2019clock when they\
  \ returned to Cyrus Harding whom Spilett had not left.</p>"
- <p>The engineer was just awaking from the sleep, or rather from the drowsiness,
  in which they had found him. The color was returning to his cheeks, which till now
  had been as pale as death. He raised himself a little, looked around him, and appeared
  to ask where he was.</p>
- "<p>\u201CCan you listen to me without fatigue, Cyrus?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt\u2019s my opinion,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cthat Captain Harding\
  \ will be able to listen to you still better, if he will have some more grouse jelly,?for\
  \ we have grouse, captain,\u201D added he, presenting him with a little of this\
  \ jelly, to which he this time added some of the flesh.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding ate a little of the grouse, and the rest was divided among his
  companions, who found it but a meager breakfast, for they were suffering extremely
  from hunger.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell!\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cthere is plenty of food at the Chimneys,\
  \ for you must know, captain, that down there, in the south, we have a house, with\
  \ rooms, beds, and fireplace, and in the pantry, several dozen of birds, which our\
  \ Herbert calls couroucous. Your litter is ready, and as soon as you feel strong\
  \ enough we will carry you home.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThanks, my friend,\u201D replied the engineer; \u201Cwait another hour\
  \ or two, and then we will set out. And now speak, Spilett.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The reporter then told him all that had occurred. He recounted all the events\
  \ with which Cyrus was unacquainted, the last fall of the balloon, the landing on\
  \ this unknown land, which appeared a desert (whatever it was, whether island or\
  \ continent), the discovery of the Chimneys, the search for him, not forgetting\
  \ of course Neb\u2019s devotion, the intelligence exhibited by the faithful Top,\
  \ as well as many other matters.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D asked Harding, in a still feeble voice, \u201Cyou did not,\
  \ then, pick me up on the beach?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd did you not bring me to this cave?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt what distance is this cave from the sea?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAbout a mile,\u201D replied Pencroft; \u201Cand if you are astonished,\
  \ captain, we are not less surprised ourselves at seeing you in this place!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIndeed,\u201D said the engineer, who was recovering gradually, and who\
  \ took great interest in these details, \u201Cindeed it is very singular!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D resumed the sailor, \u201Ccan you tell us what happened after\
  \ you were carried off by the sea?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding considered. He knew very little. The wave had torn him from the
  balloon net. He sank at first several fathoms. On returning to the surface, in the
  half light, he felt a living creature struggling near him. It was Top, who had sprung
  to his help. He saw nothing of the balloon, which, lightened both of his weight
  and that of the dog, had darted away like an arrow.</p>
- <p>There he was, in the midst of the angry sea, at a distance which could not be
  less than half a mile from the shore. He attempted to struggle against the billows
  by swimming vigorously. Top held him up by his clothes; but a strong current seized
  him and drove him towards the north, and after half an hour of exertion, he sank,
  dragging Top with him into the depths. From that moment to the moment in which he
  recovered to find himself in the arms of his friends he remembered nothing.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHowever,\u201D remarked Pencroft, \u201Cyou must have been thrown on to\
  \ the beach, and you must have had strength to walk here, since Neb found your footmarks!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes... of course,\u201D replied the engineer, thoughtfully; \u201Cand\
  \ you found no traces of human beings on this coast?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNot a trace,\u201D replied the reporter; \u201Cbesides, if by chance you\
  \ had met with some deliverer there, just in the nick of time, why should he have\
  \ abandoned you after having saved you from the waves?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are right, my dear Spilett. Tell me, Neb,\u201D added the engineer,\
  \ turning to his servant, \u201Cit was not you who... you can\u2019t have had a\
  \ moment of unconsciousness... during which no, that\u2019s absurd.... Do any of\
  \ the footsteps still remain?\u201D asked Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, master,\u201D replied Neb; \u201Chere, at the entrance, at the back\
  \ of the mound, in a place sheltered from the rain and wind. The storm has destroyed\
  \ the others.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPencroft,\u201D said Cyrus Harding, \u201Cwill you take my shoe and see\
  \ if it fits exactly to the footprints?\u201D</p>"
- <p>The sailor did as the engineer requested. While he and Herbert, guided by Neb,
  went to the place where the footprints were to be found, Cyrus remarked to the reporter,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is a most extraordinary thing!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerfectly inexplicable!\u201D replied Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut do not dwell upon it just now, my dear Spilett, we will talk about\
  \ it by\u2011and\u2011by.\u201D</p>"
- <p>A moment after the others entered.</p>
- "<p>There was no doubt about it. The engineer\u2019s shoe fitted exactly to the\
  \ footmarks. It was therefore Cyrus Harding who had left them on the sand.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCome,\u201D said he, \u201CI must have experienced this unconsciousness\
  \ which I attributed to Neb. I must have walked like a somnambulist, without any\
  \ knowledge of my steps, and Top must have guided me here, after having dragged\
  \ me from the waves... Come, Top! Come, old dog!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The magnificent animal bounded barking to his master, and caresses were lavished
  on him. It was agreed that there was no other way of accounting for the rescue of
  Cyrus Harding, and that Top deserved all the honor of the affair.</p>
- "<p>Towards twelve o\u2019clock, Pencroft having asked the engineer if they could\
  \ now remove him, Harding, instead of replying, and by an effort which exhibited\
  \ the most energetic will, got up. But he was obliged to lean on the sailor, or\
  \ he would have fallen.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell done!\u201D cried Pencroft; \u201Cbring the captain\u2019s litter.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The litter was brought; the transverse branches had been covered with leaves
  and long grass. Harding was laid on it, and Pencroft, having taken his place at
  one end and Neb at the other, they started towards the coast. There was a distance
  of eight miles to be accomplished; but, as they could not go fast, and it would
  perhaps be necessary to stop frequently, they reckoned that it would take at least
  six hours to reach the Chimneys. The wind was still strong, but fortunately it did
  not rain. Although lying down, the engineer, leaning on his elbow, observed the
  coast, particularly inland. He did not speak, but he gazed; and, no doubt, the appearance
  of the country, with its inequalities of ground, its forests, its various productions,
  were impressed on his mind. However, after traveling for two hours, fatigue overcame
  him, and he slept.</p>
- "<p>At half\u2011past five the little band arrived at the precipice, and a short\
  \ time after at the Chimneys.</p>"
- <p>They stopped, and the litter was placed on the sand; Cyrus Harding was sleeping
  profoundly, and did not awake.</p>
- "<p>Pencroft, to his extreme surprise, found that the terrible storm had quite altered\
  \ the aspect of the place. Important changes had occurred; great blocks of stone\
  \ lay on the beach, which was also covered with a thick carpet of sea\u2011weed,\
  \ algae, and wrack. Evidently the sea, passing over the islet, had been carried\
  \ right up to the foot of the enormous curtain of granite. The soil in front of\
  \ the cave had been torn away by the violence of the waves. A horrid presentiment\
  \ flashed across Pencroft\u2019s mind. He rushed into the passage, but returned\
  \ almost immediately, and stood motionless, staring at his companions.... The fire\
  \ was out; the drowned cinders were nothing but mud; the burnt linen, which was\
  \ to have served as tinder, had disappeared! The sea had penetrated to the end of\
  \ the passages, and everything was overthrown and destroyed in the interior of the\
  \ Chimneys!</p>"
- <p>Chapter 9</p>
- <p>In a few words, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb were made acquainted with what
  had happened. This accident, which appeared so very serious to Pencroft, produced
  different effects on the companions of the honest sailor.</p>
- <p>Neb, in his delight at having found his master, did not listen, or rather, did
  not care to trouble himself with what Pencroft was saying.</p>
- "<p>Herbert shared in some degree the sailor\u2019s feelings.</p>"
- <p>As to the reporter, he simply replied,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CUpon my word, Pencroft, it\u2019s perfectly indifferent to me!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, I repeat, that we haven\u2019t any fire!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPooh!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNor any means of relighting it!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNonsense!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut I say, Mr. Spilett?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIsn\u2019t Cyrus here?\u201D replied the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIs not our engineer alive? He will soon find some way of making fire for\
  \ us!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWith what?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWith nothing.\u201D</p>"
- <p>What had Pencroft to say? He could say nothing, for, in the bottom of his heart
  he shared the confidence which his companions had in Cyrus Harding. The engineer
  was to them a microcosm, a compound of every science, a possessor of all human knowledge.
  It was better to be with Cyrus in a desert island, than without him in the most
  flourishing town in the United States. With him they could want nothing; with him
  they would never despair. If these brave men had been told that a volcanic eruption
  would destroy the land, that this land would be engulfed in the depths of the Pacific,
  they would have imperturbably replied,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CCyrus is here!\u201D</p>"
- <p>While in the palanquin, however, the engineer had again relapsed into unconsciousness,
  which the jolting to which he had been subjected during his journey had brought
  on, so that they could not now appeal to his ingenuity. The supper must necessarily
  be very meager. In fact, all the grouse flesh had been consumed, and there no longer
  existed any means of cooking more game. Besides, the couroucous which had been reserved
  had disappeared. They must consider what was to be done.</p>
- "<p>First of all, Cyrus Harding was carried into the central passage. There they\
  \ managed to arrange for him a couch of sea\u2011weed which still remained almost\
  \ dry. The deep sleep which had overpowered him would no doubt be more beneficial\
  \ to him than any nourishment.</p>"
- "<p>Night had closed in, and the temperature, which had modified when the wind shifted\
  \ to the northwest, again became extremely cold. Also, the sea having destroyed\
  \ the partitions which Pencroft had put up in certain places in the passages, the\
  \ Chimneys, on account of the draughts, had become scarcely habitable. The engineer\u2019\
  s condition would, therefore, have been bad enough, if his companions had not carefully\
  \ covered him with their coats and waistcoats.</p>"
- "<p>Supper, this evening, was of course composed of the inevitable lithodomes, of\
  \ which Herbert and Neb picked up a plentiful supply on the beach. However, to these\
  \ molluscs, the lad added some edible sea\u2011weed, which he gathered on high rocks,\
  \ whose sides were only washed by the sea at the time of high tides. This sea\u2011\
  weed, which belongs to the order of Fucacae, of the genus Sargassum, produces, when\
  \ dry, a gelatinous matter, rich and nutritious. The reporter and his companions,\
  \ after having eaten a quantity of lithodomes, sucked the sargassum, of which the\
  \ taste was very tolerable. It is used in parts of the East very considerably by\
  \ the natives. \u201CNever mind!\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cthe captain will help\
  \ us soon.\u201D Meanwhile the cold became very severe, and unhappily they had no\
  \ means of defending themselves from it.</p>"
- <p>The sailor, extremely vexed, tried in all sorts of ways to procure fire. Neb
  helped him in this work. He found some dry moss, and by striking together two pebbles
  he obtained some sparks, but the moss, not being inflammable enough, did not take
  fire, for the sparks were really only incandescent, and not at all of the same consistency
  as those which are emitted from flint when struck in the same manner. The experiment,
  therefore, did not succeed.</p>
- <p>Pencroft, although he had no confidence in the proceeding, then tried rubbing
  two pieces of dry wood together, as savages do. Certainly, the movement which he
  and Neb exhibited, if it had been transformed into heat, according to the new theory,
  would have been enough to heat the boiler of a steamer! It came to nothing. The
  bits of wood became hot, to be sure, but much less so than the operators themselves.</p>
- <p>After working an hour, Pencroft, who was in a complete state of perspiration,
  threw down the pieces of wood in disgust.</p>
- "<p>\u201CI can never be made to believe that savages light their fires in this\
  \ way, let them say what they will,\u201D he exclaimed. \u201CI could sooner light\
  \ my arms by rubbing them against each other!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The sailor was wrong to despise the proceeding. Savages often kindle wood by\
  \ means of rapid rubbing. But every sort of wood does not answer for the purpose,\
  \ and besides, there is \u201Cthe knack,\u201D following the usual expression, and\
  \ it is probable that Pencroft had not \u201Cthe knack.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft\u2019s ill humor did not last long. Herbert had taken the bits of wood\
  \ which he had turned down, and was exerting himself to rub them. The hardy sailor\
  \ could not restrain a burst of laughter on seeing the efforts of the lad to succeed\
  \ where he had failed.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CRub, my boy, rub!\u201D said he.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am rubbing,\u201D replied Herbert, laughing, \u201Cbut I don\u2019t\
  \ pretend to do anything else but warm myself instead of shivering, and soon I shall\
  \ be as hot as you are, my good Pencroft!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>This soon happened. However, they were obliged to give up, for this night at\
  \ least, the attempt to procure fire. Gideon Spilett repeated, for the twentieth\
  \ time, that Cyrus Harding would not have been troubled for so small a difficulty.\
  \ And, in the meantime, he stretched himself in one of the passages on his bed of\
  \ sand. Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft did the same, while Top slept at his master\u2019\
  s feet.</p>"
- <p>Next day, the 28th of March, when the engineer awoke, about eight in the morning,
  he saw his companions around him watching his sleep, and, as on the day before,
  his first words were:?</p>
- "<p>\u201CIsland or continent?\u201D This was his uppermost thought.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell!\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cwe don\u2019t know anything about\
  \ it, captain!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou don\u2019t know yet?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut we shall know,\u201D rejoined Pencroft, \u201Cwhen you have guided\
  \ us into the country.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI think I am able to try it,\u201D replied the engineer, who, without\
  \ much effort, rose and stood upright.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat\u2019s capital!\u201D cried the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI feel dreadfully weak,\u201D replied Harding. \u201CGive me something\
  \ to eat, my friends, and it will soon go off. You have fire, haven\u2019t you?\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>This question was not immediately replied to. But, in a few seconds?</p>
- "<p>\u201CAlas! we have no fire,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cor rather, captain,\
  \ we have it no longer!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>And the sailor recounted all that had passed the day before. He amused the engineer\
  \ by the history of the single match, then his abortive attempt to procure fire\
  \ in the savages\u2019 way.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall consider,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cand if we do not\
  \ find some substance similar to tinder?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell?\u201D asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, we will make matches.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CChemicals?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CChemicals!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is not more difficult than that,\u201D cried the reporter, striking\
  \ the sailor on the shoulder.</p>"
- "<p>The latter did not think it so simple, but he did not protest. All went out.\
  \ The weather had become very fine. The sun was rising from the sea\u2019s horizon,\
  \ and touched with golden spangles the prismatic rugosities of the huge precipice.</p>"
- "<p>Having thrown a rapid glance around him, the engineer seated himself on a block\
  \ of stone. Herbert offered him a few handfuls of shell\u2011fish and sargassum,\
  \ saying,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is all that we have, Captain Harding.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThanks, my boy,\u201D replied Harding; \u201Cit will do?for this morning\
  \ at least.\u201D</p>"
- <p>He ate the wretched food with appetite, and washed it down with a little fresh
  water, drawn from the river in an immense shell.</p>
- <p>His companions looked at him without speaking. Then, feeling somewhat refreshed,
  Cyrus Harding crossed his arms, and said,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CSo, my friends, you do not know yet whether fate has thrown us on an island,\
  \ or on a continent?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, captain,\u201D replied the boy.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall know to\u2011morrow,\u201D said the engineer; \u201Ctill then,\
  \ there is nothing to be done.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFire,\u201D said the sailor, who, also, had a fixed idea.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe will make it, Pencroft,\u201D replied Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhile you were carrying me yesterday, did I not see in the west a mountain\
  \ which commands the country?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Spilett, \u201Ca mountain which must be rather high?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cwe will climb to the summit to\u2011\
  morrow, and then we shall see if this land is an island or a continent. Till then,\
  \ I repeat, there is nothing to be done.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, fire!\u201D said the obstinate sailor again.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut he will make us a fire!\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, \u201Conly have\
  \ a little patience, Pencroft!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The seaman looked at Spilett in a way which seemed to say, \u201CIf it depended\
  \ upon you to do it, we wouldn\u2019t taste roast meat very soon\u201D; but he was\
  \ silent.</p>"
- <p>Meanwhile Captain Harding had made no reply. He appeared to be very little troubled
  by the question of fire. For a few minutes he remained absorbed in thought; then
  again speaking,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friends,\u201D said he, \u201Cour situation is, perhaps, deplorable;\
  \ but, at any rate, it is very plain. Either we are on a continent, and then, at\
  \ the expense of greater or less fatigue, we shall reach some inhabited place, or\
  \ we are on an island. In the latter case, if the island is inhabited, we will try\
  \ to get out of the scrape with the help of its inhabitants; if it is desert, we\
  \ will try to get out of the scrape by ourselves.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCertainly, nothing could be plainer,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, whether it is an island or a continent,\u201D asked Gideon Spilett,\
  \ \u201Cwhereabouts do you think, Cyrus, this storm has thrown us?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI cannot say exactly,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cbut I presume\
  \ it is some land in the Pacific. In fact, when we left Richmond, the wind was blowing\
  \ from the northeast, and its very violence greatly proves that it could not have\
  \ varied. If the direction has been maintained from the northeast to the southwest,\
  \ we have traversed the States of North Carolina, of South Carolina, of Georgia,\
  \ the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico, itself, in its narrow part, then a part of the Pacific\
  \ Ocean. I cannot estimate the distance traversed by the balloon at less than six\
  \ to seven thousand miles, and, even supposing that the wind had varied half a quarter,\
  \ it must have brought us either to the archipelago of Mendava, either on the Pomotous,\
  \ or even, if it had a greater strength than I suppose, to the land of New Zealand.\
  \ If the last hypothesis is correct, it will be easy enough to get home again. English\
  \ or Maoris, we shall always find some one to whom we can speak. If, on the contrary,\
  \ this is the coast of a desert island in some tiny archipelago, perhaps we shall\
  \ be able to reconnoiter it from the summit of that peak which overlooks the country,\
  \ and then we shall see how best to establish ourselves here as if we are never\
  \ to go away.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNever?\u201D cried the reporter. \u201CYou say ?Never,\u2019 my dear Cyrus?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CBetter to put things at the worst at first,\u201D replied the engineer,\
  \ \u201Cand reserve the best for a surprise.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell said,\u201D remarked Pencroft. \u201CIt is to be hoped, too, that\
  \ this island, if it be one, is not situated just out of the course of ships; that\
  \ would be really unlucky!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall not know what we have to rely on until we have first made the\
  \ ascent of the mountain,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut to\u2011morrow, captain,\u201D asked Herbert, \u201Cshall you be in\
  \ a state to bear the fatigue of the ascent?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI hope so,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cprovided you and Pencroft,\
  \ my boy, show yourselves quick and clever hunters.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Csince you are speaking of game,\
  \ if on my return, I was as certain of roasting it as I am of bringing it back?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CBring it back all the same, Pencroft,\u201D replied Harding.</p>"
- <p>It was then agreed that the engineer and the reporter were to pass the day at
  the Chimneys, so as to examine the shore and the upper plateau. Neb, Herbert, and
  the sailor were to return to the forest, renew their store of wood, and lay violent
  hands on every creature, feathered or hairy, which might come within their reach.</p>
- "<p>They set out accordingly about ten o\u2019clock in the morning, Herbert confident,\
  \ Neb joyous, Pencroft murmuring aside,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf, on my return, I find a fire at the house, I shall believe that the\
  \ thunder itself came to light it.\u201D All three climbed the bank; and arrived\
  \ at the angle made by the river, the sailor, stopping, said to his two companions,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CShall we begin by being hunters or wood\u2011men?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHunters,\u201D replied Herbert. \u201CThere is Top already in quest.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe will hunt, then,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cand afterwards we can\
  \ come back and collect our wood.\u201D</p>"
- <p>This agreed to, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, after having torn three sticks from
  the trunk of a young fir, followed Top, who was bounding about among the long grass.</p>
- <p>This time, the hunters, instead of following the course of the river, plunged
  straight into the heart of the forest. There were still the same trees, belonging,
  for the most part, to the pine family. In certain places, less crowded, growing
  in clumps, these pines exhibited considerable dimensions, and appeared to indicate,
  by their development, that the country was situated in a higher latitude than the
  engineer had supposed. Glades, bristling with stumps worn away by time, were covered
  with dry wood, which formed an inexhaustible store of fuel. Then, the glade passed,
  the underwood thickened again, and became almost impenetrable.</p>
- <p>It was difficult enough to find the way among the groups of trees, without any
  beaten track. So the sailor from time to time broke off branches which might be
  easily recognized. But, perhaps, he was wrong not to follow the watercourse, as
  he and Herbert had done on their first excursion, for after walking an hour not
  a creature had shown itself. Top, running under the branches, only roused birds
  which could not be approached. Even the couroucous were invisible, and it was probable
  that the sailor would be obliged to return to the marshy part of the forest, in
  which he had so happily performed his grouse fishing.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, Pencroft,\u201D said Neb, in a slightly sarcastic tone, \u201Cif\
  \ this is all the game which you promised to bring back to my master, it won\u2019\
  t need a large fire to roast it!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHave patience,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cit isn\u2019t the game\
  \ which will be wanting on our return.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHave you not confidence in Captain Harding?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut you don\u2019t believe that he will make fire?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI shall believe it when the wood is blazing in the fireplace.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt will blaze, since my master has said so.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall see!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Meanwhile, the sun had not reached the highest point in its course above the\
  \ horizon. The exploration, therefore, continued, and was usefully marked by a discovery\
  \ which Herbert made of a tree whose fruit was edible. This was the stone\u2011\
  pine, which produces an excellent almond, very much esteemed in the temperate regions\
  \ of America and Europe. These almonds were in a perfect state of maturity, and\
  \ Herbert described them to his companions, who feasted on them.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCome,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Csea\u2011weed by way of bread, raw mussels\
  \ for meat, and almonds for dessert, that\u2019s certainly a good dinner for those\
  \ who have not a single match in their pocket!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe mustn\u2019t complain,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am not complaining, my boy,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Conly I repeat,\
  \ that meat is a little too much economized in this sort of meal.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTop has found something!\u201D cried Neb, who ran towards a thicket, in\
  \ the midst of which the dog had disappeared, barking. With Top\u2019s barking were\
  \ mingled curious gruntings.</p>"
- <p>The sailor and Herbert had followed Neb. If there was game there this was not
  the time to discuss how it was to be cooked, but rather, how they were to get hold
  of it.</p>
- <p>The hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw Top engaged in a struggle
  with an animal which he was holding by the ear. This quadruped was a sort of pig
  nearly two feet and a half long, of a blackish brown color, lighter below, having
  hard scanty hair; its toes, then strongly fixed in the ground, seemed to be united
  by a membrane. Herbert recognized in this animal the capybara, that is to say, one
  of the largest members of the rodent order.</p>
- <p>Meanwhile, the capybara did not struggle against the dog. It stupidly rolled
  its eyes, deeply buried in a thick bed of fat. Perhaps it saw men for the first
  time.</p>
- "<p>However, Neb having tightened his grasp on his stick, was just going to fell\
  \ the pig, when the latter, tearing itself from Top\u2019s teeth, by which it was\
  \ only held by the tip of its ear, uttered a vigorous grunt, rushed upon Herbert,\
  \ almost overthrew him, and disappeared in the wood.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe rascal!\u201D cried Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>All three directly darted after Top, but at the moment when they joined him the
  animal had disappeared under the waters of a large pond shaded by venerable pines.</p>
- <p>Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft stopped, motionless. Top plunged into the water, but
  the capybara, hidden at the bottom of the pond, did not appear.</p>
- "<p>\u201CLet us wait,\u201D said the boy, \u201Cfor he will soon come to the surface\
  \ to breathe.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWon\u2019t he drown?\u201D asked Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Herbert, \u201Csince he has webbed feet, and is almost\
  \ an amphibious animal. But watch him.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Top remained in the water. Pencroft and his two companions went to different
  parts of the bank, so as to cut off the retreat of the capybara, which the dog was
  looking for beneath the water.</p>
- "<p>Herbert was not mistaken. In a few minutes the animal appeared on the surface\
  \ of the water. Top was upon it in a bound, and kept it from plunging again. An\
  \ instant later the capybara, dragged to the bank, was killed by a blow from Neb\u2019\
  s stick.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHurrah!\u201D cried Pencroft, who was always ready with this cry of triumph.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGive me but a good fire, and this pig shall be gnawed to the bones!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>Pencroft hoisted the capybara on his shoulders, and judging by the height of\
  \ the sun that it was about two o\u2019clock, he gave the signal to return.</p>"
- "<p>Top\u2019s instinct was useful to the hunters, who, thanks to the intelligent\
  \ animal, were enabled to discover the road by which they had come. Half an hour\
  \ later they arrived at the river.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft soon made a raft of wood, as he had done before, though if there was
  no fire it would be a useless task, and the raft following the current, they returned
  towards the Chimneys.</p>
- <p>But the sailor had not gone fifty paces when he stopped, and again uttering a
  tremendous hurrah, pointed towards the angle of the cliff,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CHerbert! Neb! Look!\u201D he shouted.</p>"
- <p>Smoke was escaping and curling up among the rocks.</p>
- <p>Chapter 10</p>
- <p>In a few minutes the three hunters were before a crackling fire. The captain
  and the reporter were there. Pencroft looked from one to the other, his capybara
  in his hand, without saying a word.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, yes, my brave fellow,\u201D cried the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFire, real fire, which will roast this splendid pig perfectly, and we\
  \ will have a feast presently!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut who lighted it?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe sun!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Gideon Spilett was quite right in his reply. It was the sun which had furnished
  the heat which so astonished Pencroft. The sailor could scarcely believe his eyes,
  and he was so amazed that he did not think of questioning the engineer.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHad you a burning\u2011glass, sir?\u201D asked Herbert of Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, my boy,\u201D replied he, \u201Cbut I made one.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>And he showed the apparatus which served for a burning\u2011glass. It was simply\
  \ two glasses which he had taken from his own and the reporter\u2019s watches. Having\
  \ filled them with water and rendered their edges adhesive by means of a little\
  \ clay, he thus fabricated a regular burning\u2011glass, which, concentrating the\
  \ solar rays on some very dry moss, soon caused it to blaze.</p>"
- <p>The sailor considered the apparatus; then he gazed at the engineer without saying
  a word, only a look plainly expressed his opinion that if Cyrus Harding was not
  a magician, he was certainly no ordinary man. At last speech returned to him, and
  he cried,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CNote that, Mr. Spilett, note that down on your paper!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is noted,\u201D replied the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>Then, Neb helping him, the seaman arranged the spit, and the capybara, properly\
  \ cleaned, was soon roasting like a suckling\u2011pig before a clear, crackling\
  \ fire.</p>"
- "<p>The Chimneys had again become more habitable, not only because the passages\
  \ were warmed by the fire, but because the partitions of wood and mud had been re\u2011\
  established.</p>"
- "<p>It was evident that the engineer and his companions had employed their day well.\
  \ Cyrus Harding had almost entirely recovered his strength, and had proved it by\
  \ climbing to the upper plateau. From this point his eye, accustomed to estimate\
  \ heights and distances, was fixed for a long time on the cone, the summit of which\
  \ he wished to reach the next day. The mountain, situated about six miles to the\
  \ northwest, appeared to him to measure 3,500 feet above the level of the sea. Consequently\
  \ the gaze of an observer posted on its summit would extend over a radius of at\
  \ least fifty miles. Therefore it was probable that Harding could easily solve the\
  \ question of \u201Cisland or continent,\u201D to which he attached so much importance.</p>"
- "<p>They supped capitally. The flesh of the capybara was declared excellent. The\
  \ sargassum and the almonds of the stone\u2011pine completed the repast, during\
  \ which the engineer spoke little. He was preoccupied with projects for the next\
  \ day.</p>"
- <p>Once or twice Pencroft gave forth some ideas upon what it would be best to do;
  but Cyrus Harding, who was evidently of a methodical mind, only shook his head without
  uttering a word.</p>
- "<p>\u201CTo\u2011morrow,\u201D he repeated, \u201Cwe shall know what we have to\
  \ depend upon, and we will act accordingly.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The meal ended, fresh armfuls of wood were thrown on the fire, and the inhabitants
  of the Chimneys, including the faithful Top, were soon buried in a deep sleep.</p>
- <p>No incident disturbed this peaceful night, and the next day, the 29th of March,
  fresh and active they awoke, ready to undertake the excursion which must determine
  their fate.</p>
- "<p>All was ready for the start. The remains of the capybara would be enough to\
  \ sustain Harding and his companions for at least twenty\u2011four hours.</p>"
- "<p>Besides, they hoped to find more food on the way. As the glasses had been returned\
  \ to the watches of the engineer and reporter, Pencroft burned a little linen to\
  \ serve as tinder. As to flint, that would not be wanting in these regions of Plutonic\
  \ origin. It was half\u2011past seven in the morning when the explorers, armed with\
  \ sticks, left the Chimneys. Following Pencroft\u2019s advice, it appeared best\
  \ to take the road already traversed through the forest, and to return by another\
  \ route. It was also the most direct way to reach the mountain. They turned the\
  \ south angle and followed the left bank of the river, which was abandoned at the\
  \ point where it formed an elbow towards the southwest. The path, already trodden\
  \ under the evergreen trees, was found, and at nine o\u2019clock Cyrus Harding and\
  \ his companions had reached the western border of the forest. The ground, till\
  \ then, very little undulated, boggy at first, dry and sandy afterwards, had a gentle\
  \ slope, which ascended from the shore towards the interior of the country. A few\
  \ very timid animals were seen under the forest\u2011trees. Top quickly started\
  \ them, but his master soon called him back, for the time had not come to commence\
  \ hunting; that would be attended to later. The engineer was not a man who would\
  \ allow himself to be diverted from his fixed idea. It might even have been said\
  \ that he did not observe the country at all, either in its configuration or in\
  \ its natural productions, his great aim being to climb the mountain before him,\
  \ and therefore straight towards it he went. At ten o\u2019clock a halt of a few\
  \ minutes was made. On leaving the forest, the mountain system of the country appeared\
  \ before the explorers. The mountain was composed of two cones; the first, truncated\
  \ at a height of about two thousand five hundred feet, was sustained by buttresses,\
  \ which appeared to branch out like the talons of an immense claw set on the ground.\
  \ Between these were narrow valleys, bristling with trees, the last clumps of which\
  \ rose to the top of the lowest cone. There appeared to be less vegetation on that\
  \ side of the mountain which was exposed to the northeast, and deep fissures could\
  \ be seen which, no doubt, were watercourses.</p>"
- "<p>On the first cone rested a second, slightly rounded, and placed a little on\
  \ one side, like a great round hat cocked over the ear. A Scotchman would have said,\
  \ \u201CHis bonnet was a thocht ajee.\u201D It appeared formed of bare earth, here\
  \ and there pierced by reddish rocks.</p>"
- <p>They wished to reach the second cone, and proceeding along the ridge of the spurs
  seemed to be the best way by which to gain it.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe are on volcanic ground,\u201D Cyrus Harding had said, and his companions\
  \ following him began to ascend by degrees on the back of a spur, which, by a winding\
  \ and consequently more accessible path, joined the first plateau.</p>"
- "<p>The ground had evidently been convulsed by subterranean force. Here and there\
  \ stray blocks, numerous debris of basalt and pumice\u2011stone, were met with.\
  \ In isolated groups rose fir\u2011trees, which, some hundred feet lower, at the\
  \ bottom of the narrow gorges, formed massive shades almost impenetrable to the\
  \ sun\u2019s rays.</p>"
- <p>During the first part of the ascent, Herbert remarked on the footprints which
  indicated the recent passage of large animals.</p>
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps these beasts will not let us pass by willingly,\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D replied the reporter, who had already hunted the tiger in\
  \ India, and the lion in Africa, \u201Cwe shall soon learn how successfully to encounter\
  \ them. But in the meantime we must be upon our guard!\u201D</p>"
- <p>They ascended but slowly.</p>
- "<p>The distance, increased by detours and obstacles which could not be surmounted\
  \ directly, was long. Sometimes, too, the ground suddenly fell, and they found themselves\
  \ on the edge of a deep chasm which they had to go round. Thus, in retracing their\
  \ steps so as to find some practicable path, much time was employed and fatigue\
  \ undergone for nothing. At twelve o\u2019clock, when the small band of adventurers\
  \ halted for breakfast at the foot of a large group of firs, near a little stream\
  \ which fell in cascades, they found themselves still half way from the first plateau,\
  \ which most probably they would not reach till nightfall. From this point the view\
  \ of the sea was much extended, but on the right the high promontory prevented their\
  \ seeing whether there was land beyond it. On the left, the sight extended several\
  \ miles to the north; but, on the northwest, at the point occupied by the explorers,\
  \ it was cut short by the ridge of a fantastically\u2011shaped spur, which formed\
  \ a powerful support of the central cone.</p>"
- "<p>At one o\u2019clock the ascent was continued. They slanted more towards the\
  \ southwest and again entered among thick bushes. There under the shade of the trees\
  \ fluttered several couples of gallinaceae belonging to the pheasant species. They\
  \ were tragopans, ornamented by a pendant skin which hangs over their throats, and\
  \ by two small, round horns, planted behind the eyes. Among these birds, which were\
  \ about the size of a fowl, the female was uniformly brown, while the male was gorgeous\
  \ in his red plumage, decorated with white spots. Gideon Spilett, with a stone cleverly\
  \ and vigorously thrown, killed one of these tragopans, on which Pencroft, made\
  \ hungry by the fresh air, had cast greedy eyes.</p>"
- "<p>After leaving the region of bushes, the party, assisted by resting on each other\u2019\
  s shoulders, climbed for about a hundred feet up a steep acclivity and reached a\
  \ level place, with very few trees, where the soil appeared volcanic. It was necessary\
  \ to ascend by zigzags to make the slope more easy, for it was very steep, and the\
  \ footing being exceedingly precarious required the greatest caution. Neb and Herbert\
  \ took the lead, Pencroft the rear, the captain and the reporter between them. The\
  \ animals which frequented these heights?and there were numerous traces of them?must\
  \ necessarily belong to those races of sure foot and supple spine, chamois or goat.\
  \ Several were seen, but this was not the name Pencroft gave them, for all of a\
  \ sudden?\u201CSheep!\u201D he shouted.</p>"
- "<p>All stopped about fifty feet from half\u2011a\u2011dozen animals of a large\
  \ size, with strong horns bent back and flattened towards the point, with a woolly\
  \ fleece, hidden under long silky hair of a tawny color.</p>"
- <p>They were not ordinary sheep, but a species usually found in the mountainous
  regions of the temperate zone, to which Herbert gave the name of the musmon.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHave they legs and chops?\u201D asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, then, they are sheep!\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>The animals, motionless among the blocks of basalt, gazed with an astonished
  eye, as if they saw human bipeds for the first time. Then their fears suddenly aroused,
  they disappeared, bounding over the rocks.</p>
- "<p>\u201CGood\u2011bye, till we meet again,\u201D cried Pencroft, as he watched\
  \ them, in such a comical tone that Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and\
  \ Neb could not help laughing.</p>"
- <p>The ascent was continued. Here and there were traces of lava. Sulphur springs
  sometimes stopped their way, and they had to go round them. In some places the sulphur
  had formed crystals among other substances, such as whitish cinders made of an infinity
  of little feldspar crystals.</p>
- "<p>In approaching the first plateau formed by the truncating of the lower cone,\
  \ the difficulties of the ascent were very great. Towards four o\u2019clock the\
  \ extreme zone of the trees had been passed. There only remained here and there\
  \ a few twisted, stunted pines, which must have had a hard life in resisting at\
  \ this altitude the high winds from the open sea. Happily for the engineer and his\
  \ companions the weather was beautiful, the atmosphere tranquil; for a high breeze\
  \ at an elevation of three thousand feet would have hindered their proceedings.\
  \ The purity of the sky at the zenith was felt through the transparent air. A perfect\
  \ calm reigned around them. They could not see the sun, then hid by the vast screen\
  \ of the upper cone, which masked the half\u2011horizon of the west, and whose enormous\
  \ shadow stretching to the shore increased as the radiant luminary sank in its diurnal\
  \ course. Vapor?mist rather than clouds?began to appear in the east, and assume\
  \ all the prismatic colors under the influence of the solar rays.</p>"
- <p>Five hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau, which they wished
  to reach so as to establish there an encampment for the night, but these five hundred
  feet were increased to more than two miles by the zigzags which they had to describe.
  The soil, as it were, slid under their feet.</p>
- "<p>The slope often presented such an angle that they slipped when the stones worn\
  \ by the air did not give a sufficient support. Evening came on by degrees, and\
  \ it was almost night when Cyrus Harding and his companions, much fatigued by an\
  \ ascent of seven hours, arrived at the plateau of the first cone. It was then necessary\
  \ to prepare an encampment, and to restore their strength by eating first and sleeping\
  \ afterwards. This second stage of the mountain rose on a base of rocks, among which\
  \ it would be easy to find a retreat. Fuel was not abundant. However, a fire could\
  \ be made by means of the moss and dry brushwood, which covered certain parts of\
  \ the plateau. While the sailor was preparing his hearth with stones which he put\
  \ to this use, Neb and Herbert occupied themselves with getting a supply of fuel.\
  \ They soon returned with a load of brushwood. The steel was struck, the burnt linen\
  \ caught the sparks of flint, and, under Neb\u2019s breath, a crackling fire showed\
  \ itself in a few minutes under the shelter of the rocks. Their object in lighting\
  \ a fire was only to enable them to withstand the cold temperature of the night,\
  \ as it was not employed in cooking the bird, which Neb kept for the next day. The\
  \ remains of the capybara and some dozens of the stone\u2011pine almonds formed\
  \ their supper. It was not half\u2011past six when all was finished.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding then thought of exploring in the half\u2011light the large circular\
  \ layer which supported the upper cone of the mountain. Before taking any rest,\
  \ he wished to know if it was possible to get round the base of the cone in the\
  \ case of its sides being too steep and its summit being inaccessible. This question\
  \ preoccupied him, for it was possible that from the way the hat inclined, that\
  \ is to say, towards the north, the plateau was not practicable. Also, if the summit\
  \ of the mountain could not be reached on one side, and if, on the other, they could\
  \ not get round the base of the cone, it would be impossible to survey the western\
  \ part of the country, and their object in making the ascent would in part be altogether\
  \ unattained.</p>"
- <p>The engineer, accordingly, regardless of fatigue, leaving Pencroft and Neb to
  arrange the beds, and Gideon Spilett to note the incidents of the day, began to
  follow the edge of the plateau, going towards the north. Herbert accompanied him.</p>
- <p>The night was beautiful and still, the darkness was not yet deep. Cyrus Harding
  and the boy walked near each other, without speaking. In some places the plateau
  opened before them, and they passed without hindrance. In others, obstructed by
  rocks, there was only a narrow path, in which two persons could not walk abreast.
  After a walk of twenty minutes, Cyrus Harding and Herbert were obliged to stop.
  From this point the slope of the two cones became one. No shoulder here separated
  the two parts of the mountain. The slope, being inclined almost seventy degrees,
  the path became impracticable.</p>
- <p>But if the engineer and the boy were obliged to give up thoughts of following
  a circular direction, in return an opportunity was given for ascending the cone.</p>
- <p>In fact, before them opened a deep hollow. It was the rugged mouth of the crater,
  by which the eruptive liquid matter had escaped at the periods when the volcano
  was still in activity. Hardened lava and crusted scoria formed a sort of natural
  staircase of large steps, which would greatly facilitate the ascent to the summit
  of the mountain.</p>
- <p>Harding took all this in at a glance, and without hesitating, followed by the
  lad, he entered the enormous chasm in the midst of an increasing obscurity.</p>
- <p>There was still a height of a thousand feet to overcome. Would the interior acclivities
  of the crater be practicable? It would soon be seen. The persevering engineer resolved
  to continue his ascent until he was stopped. Happily these acclivities wound up
  the interior of the volcano and favored their ascent.</p>
- "<p>As to the volcano itself, it could not be doubted that it was completely extinct.\
  \ No smoke escaped from its sides; not a flame could be seen in the dark hollows;\
  \ not a roar, not a mutter, no trembling even issued from this black well, which\
  \ perhaps reached far into the bowels of the earth. The atmosphere inside the crater\
  \ was filled with no sulphurous vapor. It was more than the sleep of a volcano;\
  \ it was its complete extinction. Cyrus Harding\u2019s attempt would succeed.</p>"
- <p>Little by little, Herbert and he climbing up the sides of the interior, saw the
  crater widen above their heads. The radius of this circular portion of the sky,
  framed by the edge of the cone, increased obviously. At each step, as it were, that
  the explorers made, fresh stars entered the field of their vision. The magnificent
  constellations of the southern sky shone resplendently. At the zenith glittered
  the splendid Antares in the Scorpion, and not far was Alpha Centauri, which is believed
  to be the nearest star to the terrestrial globe. Then, as the crater widened, appeared
  Fomalhaut of the Fish, the Southern Triangle, and lastly, nearly at the Antarctic
  Pole, the glittering Southern Cross, which replaces the Polar Star of the Northern
  Hemisphere.</p>
- "<p>It was nearly eight o\u2019clock when Cyrus Harding and Herbert set foot on\
  \ the highest ridge of the mountain at the summit of the cone.</p>"
- <p>It was then perfectly dark, and their gaze could not extend over a radius of
  two miles. Did the sea surround this unknown land, or was it connected in the west
  with some continent of the Pacific? It could not yet be made out. Towards the west,
  a cloudy belt, clearly visible at the horizon, increased the gloom, and the eye
  could not discover if the sky and water were blended together in the same circular
  line.</p>
- <p>But at one point of the horizon a vague light suddenly appeared, which descended
  slowly in proportion as the cloud mounted to the zenith.</p>
- "<p>It was the slender crescent moon, already almost disappearing; but its light\
  \ was sufficient to show clearly the horizontal line, then detached from the cloud,\
  \ and the engineer could see its reflection trembling for an instant on a liquid\
  \ surface. Cyrus Harding seized the lad\u2019s hand, and in a grave voice,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAn island!\u201D said he, at the moment when the lunar crescent disappeared\
  \ beneath the waves.</p>"
- <p>Chapter 11</p>
- <p>Half an hour later Cyrus Harding and Herbert had returned to the encampment.
  The engineer merely told his companions that the land upon which fate had thrown
  them was an island, and that the next day they would consult. Then each settled
  himself as well as he could to sleep, and in that rocky hole, at a height of two
  thousand five hundred feet above the level of the sea, through a peaceful night,
  the islanders enjoyed profound repose.</p>
- <p>The next day, the 30th of March, after a hasty breakfast, which consisted solely
  of the roasted tragopan, the engineer wished to climb again to the summit of the
  volcano, so as more attentively to survey the island upon which he and his companions
  were imprisoned for life perhaps, should the island be situated at a great distance
  from any land, or if it was out of the course of vessels which visited the archipelagoes
  of the Pacific Ocean. This time his companions followed him in the new exploration.
  They also wished to see the island, on the productions of which they must depend
  for the supply of all their wants.</p>
- "<p>It was about seven o\u2019clock in the morning when Cyrus Harding, Herbert,\
  \ Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Neb quitted the encampment. No one appeared to be\
  \ anxious about their situation. They had faith in themselves, doubtless, but it\
  \ must be observed that the basis of this faith was not the same with Harding as\
  \ with his companions. The engineer had confidence, because he felt capable of extorting\
  \ from this wild country everything necessary for the life of himself and his companions;\
  \ the latter feared nothing, just because Cyrus Harding was with them. Pencroft\
  \ especially, since the incident of the relighted fire, would not have despaired\
  \ for an instant, even if he was on a bare rock, if the engineer was with him on\
  \ the rock.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPshaw,\u201D said he, \u201Cwe left Richmond without permission from the\
  \ authorities! It will be hard if we don\u2019t manage to get away some day or other\
  \ from a place where certainly no one will detain us!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding followed the same road as the evening before. They went round the
  cone by the plateau which formed the shoulder, to the mouth of the enormous chasm.
  The weather was magnificent. The sun rose in a pure sky and flooded with his rays
  all the eastern side of the mountain.</p>
- <p>The crater was reached. It was just what the engineer had made it out to be in
  the dark; that is to say, a vast funnel which extended, widening, to a height of
  a thousand feet above the plateau. Below the chasm, large thick streaks of lava
  wound over the sides of the mountain, and thus marked the course of the eruptive
  matter to the lower valleys which furrowed the northern part of the island.</p>
- <p>The interior of the crater, whose inclination did not exceed thirty five to forty
  degrees, presented no difficulties nor obstacles to the ascent. Traces of very ancient
  lava were noticed, which probably had overflowed the summit of the cone, before
  this lateral chasm had opened a new way to it.</p>
- <p>As to the volcanic chimney which established a communication between the subterranean
  layers and the crater, its depth could not be calculated with the eye, for it was
  lost in obscurity. But there was no doubt as to the complete extinction of the volcano.</p>
- "<p>Before eight o\u2019clock Harding and his companions were assembled at the summit\
  \ of the crater, on a conical mound which swelled the northern edge.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe sea, the sea everywhere!\u201D they cried, as if their lips could\
  \ not restrain the words which made islanders of them.</p>"
- <p>The sea, indeed, formed an immense circular sheet of water all around them! Perhaps,
  on climbing again to the summit of the cone, Cyrus Harding had had a hope of discovering
  some coast, some island shore, which he had not been able to perceive in the dark
  the evening before. But nothing appeared on the farthest verge of the horizon, that
  is to say over a radius of more than fifty miles. No land in sight. Not a sail.
  Over all this immense space the ocean alone was visible?the island occupied the
  center of a circumference which appeared to be infinite.</p>
- <p>The engineer and his companions, mute and motionless, surveyed for some minutes
  every point of the ocean, examining it to its most extreme limits. Even Pencroft,
  who possessed a marvelous power of sight, saw nothing; and certainly if there had
  been land at the horizon, if it appeared only as an indistinct vapor, the sailor
  would undoubtedly have found it out, for nature had placed regular telescopes under
  his eyebrows.</p>
- <p>From the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they commanded entirely,
  and the first question was put by Gideon Spilett in these terms:</p>
- "<p>\u201CAbout what size is this island?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Truly, it did not appear large in the midst of the immense ocean.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding reflected a few minutes; he attentively observed the perimeter
  of the island, taking into consideration the height at which he was placed; then,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friends,\u201D said he, \u201CI do not think I am mistaken in giving\
  \ to the shore of the island a circumference of more than a hundred miles.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd consequently an area?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is difficult to estimate,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cfor it\
  \ is so uneven.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>If Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island had almost\
  \ the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but it was at the same time\
  \ much more irregular and less rich in capes, promontories, points, bays, or creeks.\
  \ Its strange form caught the eye, and when Gideon Spilett, on the engineer\u2019\
  s advice, had drawn the outline, they found that it resembled some fantastic animal,\
  \ a monstrous leviathan, which lay sleeping on the surface of the Pacific.</p>"
- <p>This was in fact the exact shape of the island, which it is of consequence to
  know, and a tolerably correct map of it was immediately drawn by the reporter.</p>
- "<p>The east part of the shore, where the castaways had landed, formed a wide bay,\
  \ terminated by a sharp cape, which had been concealed by a high point from Pencroft\
  \ on his first exploration. At the northeast two other capes closed the bay, and\
  \ between them ran a narrow gulf, which looked like the half\u2011open jaws of a\
  \ formidable dog\u2011fish.</p>"
- <p>From the northeast to the southwest the coast was rounded, like the flattened
  cranium of an animal, rising again, forming a sort of protuberance which did not
  give any particular shape to this part of the island, of which the center was occupied
  by the volcano.</p>
- "<p>From this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south, broken at two\u2011\
  thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek, from which it ended in a long tail, similar\
  \ to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator.</p>"
- "<p>This tail formed a regular peninsula, which stretched more than thirty miles\
  \ into the sea, reckoning from the cape southeast of the island, already mentioned;\
  \ it curled round, making an open roadstead, which marked out the lower shore of\
  \ this strangely\u2011formed land.</p>"
- <p>At the narrowest part, that is to say between the Chimneys and the creek on the
  western shore, which corresponded to it in latitude, the island only measured ten
  miles; but its greatest length, from the jaws at the northeast to the extremity
  of the tail of the southwest, was not less than thirty miles.</p>
- <p>As to the interior of the island, its general aspect was this, very woody throughout
  the southern part from the mountain to the shore, and arid and sandy in the northern
  part. Between the volcano and the east coast Cyrus Harding and his companions were
  surprised to see a lake, bordered with green trees, the existence of which they
  had not suspected. Seen from this height, the lake appeared to be on the same level
  as the ocean, but, on reflection, the engineer explained to his companions that
  the altitude of this little sheet of water must be about three hundred feet, because
  the plateau, which was its basin, was but a prolongation of the coast.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIs it a freshwater lake?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCertainly,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cfor it must be fed by the\
  \ water which flows from the mountain.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI see a little river which runs into it,\u201D said Herbert, pointing\
  \ out a narrow stream, which evidently took its source somewhere in the west.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D said Harding; \u201Cand since this stream feeds the lake, most\
  \ probably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the surplus water\
  \ escapes. We shall see that on our return.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>This little winding watercourse and the river already mentioned constituted\
  \ the water\u2011system, at least such as it was displayed to the eyes of the explorers.\
  \ However, it was possible that under the masses of trees which covered two\u2011\
  thirds of the island, forming an immense forest, other rivers ran towards the sea.\
  \ It might even be inferred that such was the case, so rich did this region appear\
  \ in the most magnificent specimens of the flora of the temperate zones. There was\
  \ no indication of running water in the north, though perhaps there might be stagnant\
  \ water among the marshes in the northeast; but that was all, in addition to the\
  \ downs, sand, and aridity which contrasted so strongly with the luxuriant vegetation\
  \ of the rest of the island.</p>"
- <p>The volcano did not occupy the central part; it rose, on the contrary, in the
  northwestern region, and seemed to mark the boundary of the two zones. At the southwest,
  at the south, and the southeast, the first part of the spurs were hidden under masses
  of verdure. At the north, on the contrary, one could follow their ramifications,
  which died away on the sandy plains. It was on this side that, at the time when
  the mountain was in a state of eruption, the discharge had worn away a passage,
  and a large heap of lava had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the northeastern
  gulf.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding and his companions remained an hour at the top of the mountain.\
  \ The island was displayed under their eyes, like a plan in relief with different\
  \ tints, green for the forests, yellow for the sand, blue for the water. They viewed\
  \ it in its tout\u2011ensemble, nothing remained concealed but the ground hidden\
  \ by verdure, the hollows of the valleys, and the interior of the volcanic chasms.</p>"
- <p>One important question remained to be solved, and the answer would have a great
  effect upon the future of the castaways.</p>
- <p>Was the island inhabited?</p>
- <p>It was the reporter who put this question, to which after the close examination
  they had just made, the answer seemed to be in the negative.</p>
- "<p>Nowhere could the work of a human hand be perceived. Not a group of huts, not\
  \ a solitary cabin, not a fishery on the shore. No smoke curling in the air betrayed\
  \ the presence of man. It is true, a distance of nearly thirty miles separated the\
  \ observers from the extreme points, that is, of the tail which extended to the\
  \ southwest, and it would have been difficult, even to Pencroft\u2019s eyes, to\
  \ discover a habitation there. Neither could the curtain of verdure, which covered\
  \ three\u2011quarters of the island, be raised to see if it did not shelter some\
  \ straggling village. But in general the islanders live on the shores of the narrow\
  \ spaces which emerge above the waters of the Pacific, and this shore appeared to\
  \ be an absolute desert.</p>"
- <p>Until a more complete exploration, it might be admitted that the island was uninhabited.
  But was it frequented, at least occasionally, by the natives of neighboring islands?
  It was difficult to reply to this question. No land appeared within a radius of
  fifty miles. But fifty miles could be easily crossed, either by Malay proas or by
  the large Polynesian canoes. Everything depended on the position of the island,
  of its isolation in the Pacific, or of its proximity to archipelagoes. Would Cyrus
  Harding be able to find out their latitude and longitude without instruments? It
  would be difficult. Since he was in doubt, it was best to take precautions against
  a possible descent of neighboring natives.</p>
- "<p>The exploration of the island was finished, its shape determined, its features\
  \ made out, its extent calculated, the water and mountain systems ascertained. The\
  \ disposition of the forests and plains had been marked in a general way on the\
  \ reporter\u2019s plan. They had now only to descend the mountain slopes again,\
  \ and explore the soil, in the triple point of view, of its mineral, vegetable,\
  \ and animal resources.</p>"
- <p>But before giving his companions the signal for departure, Cyrus Harding said
  to them in a calm, grave voice,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CHere, my friends, is the small corner of land upon which the hand of the\
  \ Almighty has thrown us. We are going to live here; a long time, perhaps. Perhaps,\
  \ too, unexpected help will arrive, if some ship passes by chance. I say by chance,\
  \ because this is an unimportant island; there is not even a port in which ships\
  \ could anchor, and it is to be feared that it is situated out of the route usually\
  \ followed, that is to say, too much to the south for the ships which frequent the\
  \ archipelagoes of the Pacific, and too much to the north for those which go to\
  \ Australia by doubling Cape Horn. I wish to hide nothing of our position from you?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd you are right, my dear Cyrus,\u201D replied the reporter, with animation.\
  \ \u201CYou have to deal with men. They have confidence in you, and you can depend\
  \ upon them. Is it not so, my friends?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI will obey you in everything, captain,\u201D said Herbert, seizing the\
  \ engineer\u2019s hand.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy master always, and everywhere!\u201D cried Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAs for me,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cif I ever grumble at work, my\
  \ name\u2019s not Jack Pencroft, and if you like, captain, we will make a little\
  \ America of this island! We will build towns, we will establish railways, start\
  \ telegraphs, and one fine day, when it is quite changed, quite put in order and\
  \ quite civilized, we will go and offer it to the government of the Union. Only,\
  \ I ask one thing.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is that?\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is, that we do not consider ourselves castaways, but colonists, who\
  \ have come here to settle.\u201D Harding could not help smiling, and the sailor\u2019\
  s idea was adopted. He then thanked his companions, and added, that he would rely\
  \ on their energy and on the aid of Heaven.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, now let us set off to the Chimneys!\u201D cried Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COne minute, my friends,\u201D said the engineer. \u201CIt seems to me\
  \ it would be a good thing to give a name to this island, as well as to, the capes,\
  \ promontories, and watercourses, which we can see.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery good,\u201D said the reporter. \u201CIn the future, that will simplify\
  \ the instructions which we shall have to give and follow.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIndeed,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Calready it is something to be able\
  \ to say where one is going, and where one has come from. At least, it looks like\
  \ somewhere.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe Chimneys, for example,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CExactly!\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201CThat name was the most convenient,\
  \ and it came to me quite of myself. Shall we keep the name of the Chimneys for\
  \ our first encampment, captain?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Pencroft, since you have so christened it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGood! as for the others, that will be easy,\u201D returned the sailor,\
  \ who was in high spirits. \u201CLet us give them names, as the Robinsons did, whose\
  \ story Herbert has often read to me; Providence Bay, Whale Point, Cape Disappointment!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201COr, rather, the names of Captain Harding,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cof\
  \ Mr. Spilett, of Neb!?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy name!\u201D cried Neb, showing his sparkling white teeth.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy not?\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201CPort Neb, that would do very well!\
  \ And Cape Gideon?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI should prefer borrowing names from our country,\u201D said the reporter,\
  \ \u201Cwhich would remind us of America.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, for the principal ones,\u201D then said Cyrus Harding; \u201Cfor\
  \ those of the bays and seas, I admit it willingly. We might give to that vast bay\
  \ on the east the name of Union Bay, for example; to that large hollow on the south,\
  \ Washington Bay; to the mountain upon which we are standing, that of Mount Franklin;\
  \ to that lake which is extended under our eyes, that of Lake Grant; nothing could\
  \ be better, my friends. These names will recall our country, and those of the great\
  \ citizens who have honored it; but for the rivers, gulfs, capes, and promontories,\
  \ which we perceive from the top of this mountain, rather let us choose names which\
  \ will recall their particular shape. They will impress themselves better on our\
  \ memory, and at the same time will be more practical. The shape of the island is\
  \ so strange that we shall not be troubled to imagine what it resembles. As to the\
  \ streams which we do not know as yet, in different parts of the forest which we\
  \ shall explore later, the creeks which afterwards will be discovered, we can christen\
  \ them as we find them. What do you think, my friends?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The engineer\u2019s proposal was unanimously agreed to by his companions. The\
  \ island was spread out under their eyes like a map, and they had only to give names\
  \ to all its angles and points. Gideon Spilett would write them down, and the geographical\
  \ nomenclature of the island would be definitely adopted. First, they named the\
  \ two bays and the mountain, Union Bay, Washington Bay, and Mount Franklin, as the\
  \ engineer had suggested.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNow,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cto this peninsula at the southwest\
  \ of the island, I propose to give the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and that of\
  \ Reptile\u2011end to the bent tail which terminates it, for it is just like a reptile\u2019\
  s tail.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAdopted,\u201D said the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNow,\u201D said Herbert, pointing to the other extremity of the island,\
  \ \u201Clet us call this gulf which is so singularly like a pair of open jaws, Shark\
  \ Gulf.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCapital!\u201D cried Pencroft, \u201Cand we can complete the resemblance\
  \ by naming the two parts of the jaws Mandible Cape.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut there are two capes,\u201D observed the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cwe can have North Mandible Cape and\
  \ South Mandible Cape.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey are inscribed,\u201D said Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere is only the point at the southeastern extremity of the island to\
  \ be named,\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is, the extremity of Union Bay?\u201D asked Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CClaw Cape,\u201D cried Neb directly, who also wished to be godfather to\
  \ some part of his domain.</p>"
- "<p>In truth, Neb had found an excellent name, for this cape was very like the powerful\
  \ claw of the fantastic animal which this singularly\u2011shaped island represented.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft was delighted at the turn things had taken, and their imaginations soon
  gave to the river which furnished the settlers with drinking water and near which
  the balloon had thrown them, the name of the Mercy, in true gratitude to Providence.
  To the islet upon which the castaways had first landed, the name of Safety Island;
  to the plateau which crowned the high granite precipice above the Chimneys, and
  from whence the gaze could embrace the whole of the vast bay, the name of Prospect
  Heights.</p>
- <p>Lastly, all the masses of impenetrable wood which covered the Serpentine Peninsula
  were named the forests of the Far West.</p>
- <p>The nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island was thus finished,
  and later, they would complete it as they made fresh discoveries.</p>
- <p>As to the points of the compass, the engineer had roughly fixed them by the height
  and position of the sun, which placed Union Bay and Prospect Heights to the east.
  But the next day, by taking the exact hour of the rising and setting of the sun,
  and by marking its position between this rising and setting, he reckoned to fix
  the north of the island exactly, for, in consequence of its situation in the Southern
  Hemisphere, the sun, at the precise moment of its culmination, passed in the north
  and not in the south, as, in its apparent movement, it seems to do, to those places
  situated in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
- <p>Everything was finished, and the settlers had only to descend Mount Franklin
  to return to the Chimneys, when Pencroft cried out,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell! we are preciously stupid!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett, who had closed his notebook and risen\
  \ to depart.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy! our island! we have forgotten to christen it!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Herbert was going to propose to give it the engineer\u2019s name and all his\
  \ companions would have applauded him, when Cyrus Harding said simply,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us give it the name of a great citizen, my friend; of him who now\
  \ struggles to defend the unity of the American Republic! Let us call it Lincoln\
  \ Island!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The engineer\u2019s proposal was replied to by three hurrahs.</p>"
- <p>And that evening, before sleeping, the new colonists talked of their absent country;
  they spoke of the terrible war which stained it with blood; they could not doubt
  that the South would soon be subdued, and that the cause of the North, the cause
  of justice, would triumph, thanks to Grant, thanks to Lincoln!</p>
- <p>Now this happened the 30th of March, 1865. They little knew that sixteen days
  afterwards a frightful crime would be committed in Washington, and that on Good
  Friday Abraham Lincoln would fall by the hand of a fanatic.</p>
- <p>Chapter 12</p>
- "<p>They now began the descent of the mountain. Climbing down the crater, they went\
  \ round the cone and reached their encampment of the previous night. Pencroft thought\
  \ it must be breakfast\u2011time, and the watches of the reporter and engineer were\
  \ therefore consulted to find out the hour.</p>"
- "<p>That of Gideon Spilett had been preserved from the sea\u2011water, as he had\
  \ been thrown at once on the sand out of reach of the waves. It was an instrument\
  \ of excellent quality, a perfect pocket chronometer, which the reporter had not\
  \ forgotten to wind up carefully every day.</p>"
- "<p>As to the engineer\u2019s watch, it, of course, had stopped during the time\
  \ which he had passed on the downs.</p>"
- "<p>The engineer now wound it up, and ascertaining by the height of the sun that\
  \ it must be about nine o\u2019clock in the morning, he put his watch at that hour.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, my dear Spilett, wait. You have kept the Richmond time, have you not?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Cyrus.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CConsequently, your watch is set by the meridian of that town, which is\
  \ almost that of Washington?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CUndoubtedly.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery well, keep it thus. Content yourself with winding it up very, exactly,\
  \ but do not touch the hands. This may be of use to us.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat will be the good of that?\u201D thought the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>They ate, and so heartily, that the store of game and almonds was totally exhausted.\
  \ But Pencroft was not at all uneasy, they would supply themselves on the way. Top,\
  \ whose share had been very much to his taste, would know how to find some fresh\
  \ game among the brushwood. Moreover, the sailor thought of simply asking the engineer\
  \ to manufacture some powder and one or two fowling\u2011pieces; he supposed there\
  \ would be no difficulty in that.</p>"
- <p>On leaving the plateau, the captain proposed to his companions to return to the
  Chimneys by a new way. He wished to reconnoiter Lake Grant, so magnificently framed
  in trees. They therefore followed the crest of one of the spurs, between which the
  creek that supplied the lake probably had its source. In talking, the settlers already
  employed the names which they had just chosen, which singularly facilitated the
  exchange of their ideas. Herbert and Pencroft?the one young and the other very boyish?were
  enchanted, and while walking, the sailor said,</p>
- "<p>\u201CHey, Herbert! how capital it sounds! It will be impossible to lose ourselves,\
  \ my boy, since, whether we follow the way to Lake Grant, or whether we join the\
  \ Mercy through the woods of the Far West, we shall be certain to arrive at Prospect\
  \ Heights, and, consequently, at Union Bay!\u201D</p>"
- <p>It had been agreed, that without forming a compact band, the settlers should
  not stray away from each other. It was very certain that the thick forests of the
  island were inhabited by dangerous animals, and it was prudent to be on their guard.
  In general, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb walked first, preceded by Top, who poked
  his nose into every bush. The reporter and the engineer went together, Gideon Spilett
  ready to note every incident, the engineer silent for the most part, and only stepping
  aside to pick up one thing or another, a mineral or vegetable substance, which he
  put into his pocket, without making any remark.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat can he be picking up?\u201D muttered Pencroft. \u201CI have looked\
  \ in vain for anything that\u2019s worth the trouble of stooping for.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Towards ten o\u2019clock the little band descended the last declivities of Mount\
  \ Franklin. As yet the ground was scantily strewn with bushes and trees. They were\
  \ walking over yellowish calcinated earth, forming a plain of nearly a mile long,\
  \ which extended to the edge of the wood. Great blocks of that basalt, which, according\
  \ to Bischof, takes three hundred and fifty millions of years to cool, strewed the\
  \ plain, very confused in some places. However, there were here no traces of lava,\
  \ which was spread more particularly over the northern slopes.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding expected to reach, without incident, the course of the creek, which
  he supposed flowed under the trees at the border of the plain, when he saw Herbert
  running hastily back, while Neb and the sailor were hiding behind the rocks.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter, my boy?\u201D asked Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSmoke,\u201D replied Herbert. \u201CWe have seen smoke among the rocks,\
  \ a hundred paces from us.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMen in this place?\u201D cried the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe must avoid showing ourselves before knowing with whom we have to deal,\u201D\
  \ replied Cyrus Harding. \u201CI trust that there are no natives on this island;\
  \ I dread them more than anything else. Where is Top?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTop is on before.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd he doesn\u2019t bark?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is strange. However, we must try to call him back.\u201D</p>"
- <p>In a few moments, the engineer, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert had rejoined their
  two companions, and like them, they kept out of sight behind the heaps of basalt.</p>
- <p>From thence they clearly saw smoke of a yellowish color rising in the air.</p>
- <p>Top was recalled by a slight whistle from his master, and the latter, signing
  to his companions to wait for him, glided away among the rocks. The colonists, motionless,
  anxiously awaited the result of this exploration, when a shout from the engineer
  made them hasten forward. They soon joined him, and were at once struck with a disagreeable
  odor which impregnated the atmosphere.</p>
- <p>The odor, easily recognized, was enough for the engineer to guess what the smoke
  was which at first, not without cause, had startled him.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThis fire,\u201D said he, \u201Cor rather, this smoke is produced by nature\
  \ alone. There is a sulphur spring there, which will cure all our sore throats.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain!\u201D cried Pencroft. \u201CWhat a pity that I haven\u2019t got\
  \ a cold!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The settlers then directed their steps towards the place from which the smoke
  escaped. They there saw a sulphur spring which flowed abundantly between the rocks,
  and its waters discharged a strong sulphuric acid odor, after having absorbed the
  oxygen of the air.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding, dipping in his hand, felt the water oily to the touch. He tasted\
  \ it and found it rather sweet. As to its temperature, that he estimated at ninety\u2011\
  five degrees Fahrenheit. Herbert having asked on what he based this calculation,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIts quite simple, my boy,\u201D said he, \u201Cfor, in plunging my hand\
  \ into the water, I felt no sensation either of heat or cold. Therefore it has the\
  \ same temperature as the human body, which is about ninety\u2011five degrees.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers, they proceeded
  towards the thick border of the forest, which began some hundred paces off.</p>
- <p>There, as they had conjectured, the waters of the stream flowed clear and limpid
  between high banks of red earth, the color of which betrayed the presence of oxide
  of iron. From this color, the name of Red Creek was immediately given to the watercourse.</p>
- <p>It was only a large stream, deep and clear, formed of the mountain water, which,
  half river, half torrent, here rippling peacefully over the sand, there falling
  against the rocks or dashing down in a cascade, ran towards the lake, over a distance
  of a mile and a half, its breadth varying from thirty to forty feet. Its waters
  were sweet, and it was supposed that those of the lake were so also. A fortunate
  circumstance, in the event of their finding on its borders a more suitable dwelling
  than the Chimneys.</p>
- "<p>As to the trees, which some hundred feet downwards shaded the banks of the creek,\
  \ they belonged, for the most part, to the species which abound in the temperate\
  \ zone of America and Tasmania, and no longer to those coniferae observed in that\
  \ portion of the island already explored to some miles from Prospect Heights. At\
  \ this time of the year, the commencement of the month of April, which represents\
  \ the month of October, in this hemisphere, that is, the beginning of autumn, they\
  \ were still in full leaf. They consisted principally of casuarinas and eucalypti,\
  \ some of which next year would yield a sweet manna, similar to the manna of the\
  \ East. Clumps of Australian cedars rose on the sloping banks, which were also covered\
  \ with the high grass called \u201Ctussac\u201D in New Holland; but the cocoanut,\
  \ so abundant in the archipelagoes of the Pacific, seemed to be wanting in the island,\
  \ the latitude, doubtless, being too low.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat a pity!\u201D said Herbert, \u201Csuch a useful tree, and which has\
  \ such beautiful nuts!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>As to the birds, they swarmed among the scanty branches of the eucalypti and\
  \ casuarinas, which did not hinder the display of their wings. Black, white, or\
  \ gray cockatoos, paroquets, with plumage of all colors, kingfishers of a sparkling\
  \ green and crowned with red, blue lories, and various other birds appeared on all\
  \ sides, as through a prism, fluttering about and producing a deafening clamor.\
  \ Suddenly, a strange concert of discordant voices resounded in the midst of a thicket.\
  \ The settlers heard successively the song of birds, the cry of quadrupeds, and\
  \ a sort of clacking which they might have believed to have escaped from the lips\
  \ of a native. Neb and Herbert rushed towards the bush, forgetting even the most\
  \ elementary principles of prudence. Happily, they found there, neither a formidable\
  \ wild beast nor a dangerous native, but merely half a dozen mocking and singing\
  \ birds, known as mountain pheasants. A few skillful blows from a stick soon put\
  \ an end to their concert, and procured excellent food for the evening\u2019s dinner.</p>"
- "<p>Herbert also discovered some magnificent pigeons with bronzed wings, some superbly\
  \ crested, others draped in green, like their congeners at Port\u2011Macquarie;\
  \ but it was impossible to reach them, or the crows and magpies which flew away\
  \ in flocks.</p>"
- <p>A charge of small shot would have made great slaughter among these birds, but
  the hunters were still limited to sticks and stones, and these primitive weapons
  proved very insufficient.</p>
- <p>Their insufficiency was still more clearly shown when a troop of quadrupeds,
  jumping, bounding, making leaps of thirty feet, regular flying mammiferae, fled
  over the thickets, so quickly and at such a height, that one would have thought
  that they passed from one tree to another like squirrels.</p>
- "<p>\u201CKangaroos!\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAre they good to eat?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CStewed,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Ctheir flesh is equal to the\
  \ best venison!?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Gideon Spilett had not finished this exciting sentence when the sailor, followed
  by Neb and Herbert, darted on the kangaroos tracks. Cyrus Harding called them back
  in vain. But it was in vain too for the hunters to pursue such agile game, which
  went bounding away like balls. After a chase of five minutes, they lost their breath,
  and at the same time all sight of the creatures, which disappeared in the wood.
  Top was not more successful than his masters.</p>
- "<p>\u201CCaptain,\u201D said Pencroft, when the engineer and the reporter had rejoined\
  \ them, \u201CCaptain, you see quite well we can\u2019t get on unless we make a\
  \ few guns. Will that be possible?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cbut we will begin by first\
  \ manufacturing some bows and arrows, and I don\u2019t doubt that you will become\
  \ as clever in the use of them as the Australian hunters.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBows and arrows!\u201D said Pencroft scornfully. \u201CThat\u2019s all\
  \ very well for children!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDon\u2019t be proud, friend Pencroft,\u201D replied the reporter. \u201C\
  Bows and arrows were sufficient for centuries to stain the earth with blood. Powder\
  \ is but a thing of yesterday, and war is as old as the human race?unhappily.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CFaith, that\u2019s true, Mr. Spilett,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201C\
  and I always speak too quickly. You must excuse me!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Meanwhile, Herbert constant to his favorite science, Natural History, reverted
  to the kangaroos, saying,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CBesides, we had to deal just now with the species which is most difficult\
  \ to catch. They were giants with long gray fur; but if I am not mistaken, there\
  \ exist black and red kangaroos, rock kangaroos, and rat kangaroos, which are more\
  \ easy to get hold of. It is reckoned that there are about a dozen species.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CHerbert,\u201D replied the sailor sententiously, \u201Cthere is only one\
  \ species of kangaroos to me, that is ?kangaroo on the spit,\u2019 and it\u2019\
  s just the one we haven\u2019t got this evening!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>They could not help laughing at Master Pencroft\u2019s new classification. The\
  \ honest sailor did not hide his regret at being reduced for dinner to the singing\
  \ pheasants, but fortune once more showed itself obliging to him.</p>"
- <p>In fact, Top, who felt that his interest was concerned went and ferreted everywhere
  with an instinct doubled by a ferocious appetite. It was even probable that if some
  piece of game did fall into his clutches, none would be left for the hunters, if
  Top was hunting on his own account; but Neb watched him and he did well.</p>
- "<p>Towards three o\u2019clock the dog disappeared in the brushwood and gruntings\
  \ showed that he was engaged in a struggle with some animal. Neb rushed after him,\
  \ and soon saw Top eagerly devouring a quadruped, which ten seconds later would\
  \ have been past recognizing in Top\u2019s stomach. But fortunately the dog had\
  \ fallen upon a brood, and besides the victim he was devouring, two other rodents?the\
  \ animals in question belonged to that order?lay strangled on the turf.</p>"
- <p>Neb reappeared triumphantly holding one of the rodents in each hand. Their size
  exceeded that of a rabbit, their hair was yellow, mingled with green spots, and
  they had the merest rudiments of tails.</p>
- <p>The citizens of the Union were at no loss for the right name of these rodents.
  They were maras, a sort of agouti, a little larger than their congeners of tropical
  countries, regular American rabbits, with long ears, jaws armed on each side with
  five molars, which distinguish the agouti.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHurrah!\u201D cried Pencroft, \u201Cthe roast has arrived! and now we\
  \ can go home.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The walk, interrupted for an instant, was resumed. The limpid waters of the\
  \ Red Creek flowed under an arch of casuarinas, banksias, and gigantic gum\u2011\
  trees. Superb lilacs rose to a height of twenty feet. Other arborescent species,\
  \ unknown to the young naturalist, bent over the stream, which could be heard murmuring\
  \ beneath the bowers of verdure.</p>"
- <p>Meanwhile the stream grew much wider, and Cyrus Harding supposed that they would
  soon reach its mouth. In fact, on emerging from beneath a thick clump of beautiful
  trees, it suddenly appeared before their eyes.</p>
- "<p>The explorers had arrived on the western shore of Lake Grant. The place was\
  \ well worth looking at. This extent of water, of a circumference of nearly seven\
  \ miles and an area of two hundred and fifty acres, reposed in a border of diversified\
  \ trees. Towards the east, through a curtain of verdure, picturesquely raised in\
  \ some places, sparkled an horizon of sea. The lake was curved at the north, which\
  \ contrasted with the sharp outline of its lower part. Numerous aquatic birds frequented\
  \ the shores of this little Ontario, in which the thousand isles of its American\
  \ namesake were represented by a rock which emerged from its surface, some hundred\
  \ feet from the southern shore. There lived in harmony several couples of kingfishers\
  \ perched on a stone, grave, motionless, watching for fish, then darting down, they\
  \ plunged in with a sharp cry, and reappeared with their prey in their beaks. On\
  \ the shores and on the islets, strutted wild ducks, pelicans, water\u2011hens,\
  \ red\u2011beaks, philedons, furnished with a tongue like a brush, and one or two\
  \ specimens of the splendid menura, the tail of which expands gracefully like a\
  \ lyre.</p>"
- <p>As to the water of the lake, it was sweet, limpid, rather dark, and from certain
  bubblings, and the concentric circles which crossed each other on the surface, it
  could not be doubted that it abounded in fish.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThis lake is really beautiful!\u201D said Gideon Spilett. \u201CWe could\
  \ live on its borders!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe will live there!\u201D replied Harding.</p>"
- "<p>The settlers, wishing to return to the Chimneys by the shortest way, descended\
  \ towards the angle formed on the south by the junction of the lake\u2019s bank.\
  \ It was not without difficulty that they broke a path through the thickets and\
  \ brushwood which had never been put aside by the hand of men, and they thus went\
  \ towards the shore, so as to arrive at the north of Prospect Heights. Two miles\
  \ were cleared in this direction, and then, after they had passed the last curtain\
  \ of trees, appeared the plateau, carpeted with thick turf, and beyond that the\
  \ infinite sea.</p>"
- <p>To return to the Chimneys, it was enough to cross the plateau obliquely for the
  space of a mile, and then to descend to the elbow formed by the first detour of
  the Mercy. But the engineer desired to know how and where the overplus of the water
  from the lake escaped, and the exploration was prolonged under the trees for a mile
  and a half towards the north. It was most probable that an overfall existed somewhere,
  and doubtless through a cleft in the granite. This lake was only, in short, an immense
  center basin, which was filled by degrees by the creek, and its waters must necessarily
  pass to the sea by some fall. If it was so, the engineer thought that it might perhaps
  be possible to utilize this fall and borrow its power, actually lost without profit
  to any one. They continued then to follow the shores of Lake Grant by climbing the
  plateau; but, after having gone a mile in this direction, Cyrus Harding had not
  been able to discover the overfall, which, however, must exist somewhere.</p>
- "<p>It was then half\u2011past four. In order to prepare for dinner it was necessary\
  \ that the settlers should return to their dwelling. The little band retraced their\
  \ steps, therefore, and by the left bank of the Mercy, Cyrus Harding and his companions\
  \ arrived at the Chimneys.</p>"
- <p>The fire was lighted, and Neb and Pencroft, on whom the functions of cooks naturally
  devolved, to the one in his quality of Negro, to the other in that of sailor, quickly
  prepared some broiled agouti, to which they did great justice.</p>
- <p>The repast at length terminated; at the moment when each one was about to give
  himself up to sleep, Cyrus Harding drew from his pocket little specimens of different
  sorts of minerals, and just said,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friends, this is iron mineral, this a pyrite, this is clay, this is\
  \ lime, and this is coal. Nature gives us these things. It is our business to make\
  \ a right use of them. To\u2011morrow we will commence operations.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 13</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, captain, where are we going to begin?\u201D asked Pencroft next\
  \ morning of the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt the beginning,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>And in fact, the settlers were compelled to begin \u201Cat the very beginning.\u201D\
  \ They did not possess even the tools necessary for making tools, and they were\
  \ not even in the condition of nature, who, \u201Chaving time, husbands her strength.\u201D\
  \ They had no time, since they had to provide for the immediate wants of their existence,\
  \ and though, profiting by acquired experience, they had nothing to invent, still\
  \ they had everything to make; their iron and their steel were as yet only in the\
  \ state of minerals, their earthenware in the state of clay, their linen and their\
  \ clothes in the state of textile material.</p>"
- "<p>It must be said, however, that the settlers were \u201Cmen\u201D in the complete\
  \ and higher sense of the word. The engineer Harding could not have been seconded\
  \ by more intelligent companions, nor with more devotion and zeal. He had tried\
  \ them. He knew their abilities.</p>"
- '<p>Gideon Spilett, a talented reporter, having learned everything so as to be able
  to speak of everything, would contribute largely with his head and hands to the
  colonization of the island. He would not draw back from any task: a determined sportsman,
  he would make a business of what till then had only been a pleasure to him.</p>'
- <p>Herbert, a gallant boy, already remarkably well informed in the natural sciences,
  would render greater service to the common cause.</p>
- <p>Neb was devotion personified. Clever, intelligent, indefatigable, robust, with
  iron health, he knew a little about the work of the forge, and could not fail to
  be very useful in the colony.</p>
- <p>As to Pencroft, he had sailed over every sea, a carpenter in the dockyards in
  Brooklyn, assistant tailor in the vessels of the state, gardener, cultivator, during
  his holidays, etc., and like all seamen, fit for anything, he knew how to do everything.</p>
- <p>It would have been difficult to unite five men, better fitted to struggle against
  fate, more certain to triumph over it.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAt the beginning,\u201D Cyrus Harding had said. Now this beginning of\
  \ which the engineer spoke was the construction of an apparatus which would serve\
  \ to transform the natural substances. The part which heat plays in these transformations\
  \ is known. Now fuel, wood or coal, was ready for immediate use, an oven must be\
  \ built to use it.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is this oven for?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo make the pottery which we have need of,\u201D replied Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd of what shall we make the oven?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWith bricks.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd the bricks?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWith clay. Let us start, my friends. To save trouble, we will establish\
  \ our manufactory at the place of production. Neb will bring provisions, and there\
  \ will be no lack of fire to cook the food.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied the reporter; \u201Cbut if there is a lack of food for\
  \ want of instruments for the chase?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh, if we only had a knife!\u201D cried the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell?\u201D asked Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell! I would soon make a bow and arrows, and then there could be plenty\
  \ of game in the larder!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, a knife, a sharp blade.\u201D said the engineer, as if he was speaking\
  \ to himself.</p>"
- "<p>At this moment his eyes fell upon Top, who was running about on the shore. Suddenly\
  \ Harding\u2019s face became animated.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTop, here,\u201D said he.</p>"
- "<p>The dog came at his master\u2019s call. The latter took Top\u2019s head between\
  \ his hands, and unfastening the collar which the animal wore round his neck, he\
  \ broke it in two, saying,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere are two knives, Pencroft!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Two hurrahs from the sailor was the reply. Top\u2019s collar was made of a thin\
  \ piece of tempered steel. They had only to sharpen it on a piece of sandstone,\
  \ then to raise the edge on a finer stone. Now sandstone was abundant on the beach,\
  \ and two hours after the stock of tools in the colony consisted of two sharp blades,\
  \ which were easily fixed in solid handles.</p>"
- <p>The production of these their first tools was hailed as a triumph. It was indeed
  a valuable result of their labor, and a very opportune one. They set out.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding proposed that they should return to the western shore of the lake,
  where the day before he had noticed the clayey ground of which he possessed a specimen.
  They therefore followed the bank of the Mercy, traversed Prospect Heights, and after
  a walk of five miles or more they reached a glade, situated two hundred feet from
  Lake Grant.</p>
- "<p>On the way Herbert had discovered a tree, the branches of which the Indians\
  \ of South America employ for making their bows. It was the crejimba, of the palm\
  \ family, which does not bear edible fruit. Long straight branches were cut, the\
  \ leaves stripped off; it was shaped, stronger in the middle, more slender at the\
  \ extremities, and nothing remained to be done but to find a plant fit to make the\
  \ bow\u2011string. This was the \u201Chibiscus heterophyllus,\u201D which furnishes\
  \ fibers of such remarkable tenacity that they have been compared to the tendons\
  \ of animals. Pencroft thus obtained bows of tolerable strength, for which he only\
  \ wanted arrows. These were easily made with straight stiff branches, without knots,\
  \ but the points with which they must be armed, that is to say, a substance to serve\
  \ in lieu of iron, could not be met with so easily. But Pencroft said, that having\
  \ done his part of the work, chance would do the rest.</p>"
- <p>The settlers arrived on the ground which had been discovered the day before.
  Being composed of the sort of clay which is used for making bricks and tiles, it
  was very useful for the work in question. There was no great difficulty in it. It
  was enough to scour the clay with sand, then to mold the bricks and bake them by
  the heat of a wood fire.</p>
- <p>Generally bricks are formed in molds, but the engineer contented himself with
  making them by hand. All that day and the day following were employed in this work.
  The clay, soaked in water, was mixed by the feet and hands of the manipulators,
  and then divided into pieces of equal size. A practiced workman can make, without
  a machine, about ten thousand bricks in twelve hours; but in their two days work
  the five brickmakers on Lincoln Island had not made more than three thousand, which
  were ranged near each other, until the time when their complete desiccation would
  permit them to be used in building the oven, that is to say, in three or four days.</p>
- "<p>It was on the 2nd of April that Harding had employed himself in fixing the orientation\
  \ of the island, or, in other words, the precise spot where the sun rose. The day\
  \ before he had noted exactly the hour when the sun disappeared beneath the horizon,\
  \ making allowance for the refraction. This morning he noted, no less exactly, the\
  \ hour at which it reappeared. Between this setting and rising twelve hours, twenty\u2011\
  four minutes passed. Then, six hours, twelve minutes after its rising, the sun on\
  \ this day would exactly pass the meridian and the point of the sky which it occupied\
  \ at this moment would be the north. At the said hour, Cyrus marked this point,\
  \ and putting in a line with the sun two trees which would serve him for marks,\
  \ he thus obtained an invariable meridian for his ulterior operations.</p>"
- "<p>The settlers employed the two days before the oven was built in collecting fuel.\
  \ Branches were cut all round the glade, and they picked up all the fallen wood\
  \ under the trees. They were also able to hunt with greater success, since Pencroft\
  \ now possessed some dozen arrows armed with sharp points. It was Top who had furnished\
  \ these points, by bringing in a porcupine, rather inferior eating, but of great\
  \ value, thanks to the quills with which it bristled. These quills were fixed firmly\
  \ at the ends of the arrows, the flight of which was made more certain by some cockatoos\u2019\
  \ feathers. The reporter and Herbert soon became very skilful archers. Game of all\
  \ sorts in consequence abounded at the Chimneys, capybaras, pigeons, agouties, grouse,\
  \ etc. The greater part of these animals were killed in the part of the forest on\
  \ the left bank of the Mercy, to which they gave the name of Jacamar Wood, in remembrance\
  \ of the bird which Pencroft and Herbert had pursued when on their first exploration.</p>"
- "<p>This game was eaten fresh, but they preserved some capybara hams, by smoking\
  \ them above a fire of green wood, after having perfumed them with sweet\u2011smelling\
  \ leaves. However, this food, although very strengthening, was always roast upon\
  \ roast, and the party would have been delighted to hear some soup bubbling on the\
  \ hearth, but they must wait till a pot could be made, and, consequently, till the\
  \ oven was built.</p>"
- "<p>During these excursions, which were not extended far from the brick\u2011field,\
  \ the hunters could discern the recent passage of animals of a large size, armed\
  \ with powerful claws, but they could not recognize the species. Cyrus Harding advised\
  \ them to be very careful, as the forest probably enclosed many dangerous beasts.</p>"
- <p>And he did right. Indeed, Gideon Spilett and Herbert one day saw an animal which
  resembled a jaguar. Happily the creature did not attack them, or they might not
  have escaped without a severe wound. As soon as he could get a regular weapon, that
  is to say, one of the guns which Pencroft begged for, Gideon Spilett resolved to
  make desperate war against the ferocious beasts, and exterminate them from the island.</p>
- <p>The Chimneys during these few days was not made more comfortable, for the engineer
  hoped to discover, or build if necessary, a more convenient dwelling. They contented
  themselves with spreading moss and dry leaves on the sand of the passages, and on
  these primitive couches the tired workers slept soundly.</p>
- <p>They also reckoned the days they had passed on Lincoln Island, and from that
  time kept a regular account. The 5th of April, which was Wednesday, was twelve days
  from the time when the wind threw the castaways on this shore.</p>
- "<p>On the 6th of April, at daybreak, the engineer and his companions were collected\
  \ in the glade, at the place where they were going to perform the operation of baking\
  \ the bricks. Naturally this had to be in the open air, and not in a kiln, or rather,\
  \ the agglomeration of bricks made an enormous kiln, which would bake itself. The\
  \ fuel, made of well\u2011prepared fagots, was laid on the ground and surrounded\
  \ with several rows of dried bricks, which soon formed an enormous cube, to the\
  \ exterior of which they contrived air\u2011holes. The work lasted all day, and\
  \ it was not till the evening that they set fire to the fagots. No one slept that\
  \ night, all watching carefully to keep up the fire.</p>"
- "<p>The operation lasted forty\u2011eight hours, and succeeded perfectly. It then\
  \ became necessary to leave the smoking mass to cool, and during this time Neb and\
  \ Pencroft, guided by Cyrus Harding, brought, on a hurdle made of interlaced branches,\
  \ loads of carbonate of lime and common stones, which were very abundant, to the\
  \ north of the lake. These stones, when decomposed by heat, made a very strong quicklime,\
  \ greatly increased by slacking, at least as pure as if it had been produced by\
  \ the calcination of chalk or marble. Mixed with sand the lime made excellent mortar.</p>"
- <p>The result of these different works was, that, on the 9th of April, the engineer
  had at his disposal a quantity of prepared lime and some thousands of bricks.</p>
- <p>Without losing an instant, therefore, they began the construction of a kiln to
  bake the pottery, which was indispensable for their domestic use. They succeeded
  without much difficulty. Five days after, the kiln was supplied with coal, which
  the engineer had discovered lying open to the sky towards the mouth of the Red Creek,
  and the first smoke escaped from a chimney twenty feet high. The glade was transformed
  into a manufactory, and Pencroft was not far wrong in believing that from this kiln
  would issue all the products of modern industry.</p>
- "<p>In the meantime what the settlers first manufactured was a common pottery in\
  \ which to cook their food. The chief material was clay, to which Harding added\
  \ a little lime and quartz. This paste made regular \u201Cpipe\u2011clay,\u201D\
  \ with which they manufactured bowls, cups molded on stones of a proper size, great\
  \ jars and pots to hold water, etc. The shape of these objects was clumsy and defective,\
  \ but after they had been baked in a high temperature, the kitchen of the Chimneys\
  \ was provided with a number of utensils, as precious to the settlers as the most\
  \ beautifully enameled china. We must mention here that Pencroft, desirous to know\
  \ if the clay thus prepared was worthy of its name of pipe\u2011clay, made some\
  \ large pipes, which he thought charming, but for which, alas! he had no tobacco,\
  \ and that was a great privation to Pencroft. \u201CBut tobacco will come, like\
  \ everything else!\u201D he repeated, in a burst of absolute confidence.</p>"
- <p>This work lasted till the 15th of April, and the time was well employed. The
  settlers, having become potters, made nothing but pottery. When it suited Cyrus
  Harding to change them into smiths, they would become smiths. But the next day being
  Sunday, and also Easter Sunday, all agreed to sanctify the day by rest. These Americans
  were religious men, scrupulous observers of the precepts of the Bible, and their
  situation could not but develop sentiments of confidence towards the Author of all
  things.</p>
- "<p>On the evening of the 15th of April they returned to the Chimneys, carrying\
  \ with them the pottery, the furnace being extinguished until they could put it\
  \ to a new use. Their return was marked by a fortunate incident; the engineer discovered\
  \ a substance which replaced tinder. It is known that a spongy, velvety flesh is\
  \ procured from a certain mushroom of the genus polyporous. Properly prepared, it\
  \ is extremely inflammable, especially when it has been previously saturated with\
  \ gunpowder, or boiled in a solution of nitrate or chlorate of potash. But, till\
  \ then, they had not found any of these polypores or even any of the morels which\
  \ could replace them. On this day, the engineer, seeing a plant belonging to the\
  \ wormwood genus, the principal species of which are absinthe, balm\u2011mint, tarragon,\
  \ etc., gathered several tufts, and, presenting them to the sailor, said,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHere, Pencroft, this will please you.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Pencroft looked attentively at the plant, covered with long silky hair, the leaves
  being clothed with soft down.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat\u2019s that, captain?\u201D asked Pencroft. \u201CIs it tobacco?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Harding, \u201Cit is wormwood; Chinese wormwood to the\
  \ learned, but to us it will be tinder.\u201D</p>"
- <p>When the wormwood was properly dried it provided them with a very inflammable
  substance, especially afterwards when the engineer had impregnated it with nitrate
  of potash, of which the island possessed several beds, and which is in truth saltpeter.</p>
- "<p>The colonists had a good supper that evening. Neb prepared some agouti soup,\
  \ a smoked capybara ham, to which was added the boiled tubercules of the \u201C\
  caladium macrorhizum,\u201D an herbaceous plant of the arum family. They had an\
  \ excellent taste, and were very nutritious, being something similar to the substance\
  \ which is sold in England under the name of \u201CPortland sago\u201D; they were\
  \ also a good substitute for bread, which the settlers in Lincoln Island did not\
  \ yet possess.</p>"
- "<p>When supper was finished, before sleeping, Harding and his companions went to\
  \ take the air on the beach. It was eight o\u2019clock in the evening; the night\
  \ was magnificent. The moon, which had been full five days before, had not yet risen,\
  \ but the horizon was already silvered by those soft, pale shades which might be\
  \ called the dawn of the moon. At the southern zenith glittered the circumpolar\
  \ constellations, and above all the Southern Cross, which some days before the engineer\
  \ had greeted on the summit of Mount Franklin.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding gazed for some time at this splendid constellation, which has at
  its summit and at its base two stars of the first magnitude, at its left arm a star
  of the second, and at its right arm a star of the third magnitude.</p>
- <p>Then, after some minutes thought?</p>
- "<p>\u201CHerbert,\u201D he asked of the lad, \u201Cis not this the 15th of April?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, captain,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, if I am not mistaken, to\u2011morrow will be one of the four days\
  \ in the year in which the real time is identical with average time; that is to\
  \ say, my boy, that to\u2011morrow, to within some seconds, the sun will pass the\
  \ meridian just at midday by the clocks. If the weather is fine I think that I shall\
  \ obtain the longitude of the island with an approximation of some degrees.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWithout instruments, without sextant?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied the engineer. \u201CAlso, since the night is clear,\
  \ I will try, this very evening, to obtain our latitude by calculating the height\
  \ of the Southern Cross, that is, from the southern pole above the horizon. You\
  \ understand, my friends, that before undertaking the work of installation in earnest\
  \ it is not enough to have found out that this land is an island; we must, as nearly\
  \ as possible, know at what distance it is situated, either from the American continent\
  \ or Australia, or from the principal archipelagoes of the Pacific.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn fact,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cinstead of building a house it\
  \ would be more important to build a boat, if by chance we are not more than a hundred\
  \ miles from an inhabited coast.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is why,\u201D returned Harding, \u201CI am going to try this evening\
  \ to calculate the latitude of Lincoln Island, and to\u2011morrow, at midday, I\
  \ will try to calculate the longitude.\u201D</p>"
- <p>If the engineer had possessed a sextant, an apparatus with which the angular
  distance of objects can be measured with great precision, there would have been
  no difficulty in the operation. This evening by the height of the pole, the next
  day by the passing of the sun at the meridian, he would obtain the position of the
  island. But as they had not one he would have to supply the deficiency.</p>
- <p>Harding then entered the Chimneys. By the light of the fire he cut two little
  flat rulers, which he joined together at one end so as to form a pair of compasses,
  whose legs could separate or come together. The fastening was fixed with a strong
  acacia thorn which was found in the wood pile. This instrument finished, the engineer
  returned to the beach, but as it was necessary to take the height of the pole from
  above a clear horizon, that is, a sea horizon, and as Claw Cape hid the southern
  horizon, he was obliged to look for a more suitable station. The best would evidently
  have been the shore exposed directly to the south; but the Mercy would have to be
  crossed, and that was a difficulty. Harding resolved, in consequence, to make his
  observation from Prospect Heights, taking into consideration its height above the
  level of the sea?a height which he intended to calculate next day by a simple process
  of elementary geometry.</p>
- "<p>The settlers, therefore, went to the plateau, ascending the left bank of the\
  \ Mercy, and placed themselves on the edge which looked northwest and southeast,\
  \ that is, above the curiously\u2011shaped rocks which bordered the river.</p>"
- "<p>This part of the plateau commanded the heights of the left bank, which sloped\
  \ away to the extremity of Claw Cape, and to the southern side of the island. No\
  \ obstacle intercepted their gaze, which swept the horizon in a semi\u2011circle\
  \ from the cape to Reptile End. To the south the horizon, lighted by the first rays\
  \ of the moon, was very clearly defined against the sky.</p>"
- <p>At this moment the Southern Cross presented itself to the observer in an inverted
  position, the star Alpha marking its base, which is nearer to the southern pole.</p>
- "<p>This constellation is not situated as near to the antarctic pole as the Polar\
  \ Star is to the arctic pole. The star Alpha is about twenty\u2011seven degrees\
  \ from it, but Cyrus Harding knew this and made allowance for it in his calculation.\
  \ He took care also to observe the moment when it passed the meridian below the\
  \ pole, which would simplify the operation.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding pointed one leg of the compasses to the horizon, the other to Alpha,
  and the space between the two legs gave him the angular distance which separated
  Alpha from the horizon. In order to fix the angle obtained, he fastened with thorns
  the two pieces of wood on a third placed transversely, so that their separation
  should be properly maintained.</p>
- <p>That done, there was only the angle to calculate by bringing back the observation
  to the level of the sea, taking into consideration the depression of the horizon,
  which would necessitate measuring the height of the cliff. The value of this angle
  would give the height of Alpha, and consequently that of the pole above the horizon,
  that is to say, the latitude of the island, since the latitude of a point of the
  globe is always equal to the height of the pole above the horizon of this point.</p>
- "<p>The calculations were left for the next day, and at ten o\u2019clock every one\
  \ was sleeping soundly.</p>"
- <p>Chapter 14</p>
- "<p>The next day, the 16th of April, and Easter Sunday, the settlers issued from\
  \ the Chimneys at daybreak, and proceeded to wash their linen. The engineer intended\
  \ to manufacture soap as soon as he could procure the necessary materials?soda or\
  \ potash, fat or oil. The important question of renewing their wardrobe would be\
  \ treated of in the proper time and place. At any rate their clothes would last\
  \ at least six months longer, for they were strong, and could resist the wear of\
  \ manual labor. But all would depend on the situation of the island with regard\
  \ to inhabited land. This would be settled to\u2011day if the weather permitted.</p>"
- <p>The sun rising above a clear horizon, announced a magnificent day, one of those
  beautiful autumn days which are like the last farewells of the warm season.</p>
- <p>It was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening before by measuring
  the height of the cliff above the level of the sea.</p>
- "<p>\u201CShall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you used yesterday?\u201D\
  \ said Herbert to the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, my boy,\u201D replied the latter, \u201Cwe are going to proceed differently,\
  \ but in as precise a way.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Herbert, wishing to learn everything he could, followed the engineer to the beach.
  Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter remained behind and occupied themselves in different
  ways.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding had provided himself with a straight stick, twelve feet long,\
  \ which he had measured as exactly as possible by comparing it with his own height,\
  \ which he knew to a hair. Herbert carried a plumb\u2011line which Harding had given\
  \ him, that is to say, a simple stone fastened to the end of a flexible fiber. Having\
  \ reached a spot about twenty feet from the edge of the beach, and nearly five hundred\
  \ feet from the cliff, which rose perpendicularly, Harding thrust the pole two feet\
  \ into the sand, and wedging it up carefully, he managed, by means of the plumb\u2011\
  line, to erect it perpendicularly with the plane of the horizon.</p>"
- <p>That done, he retired the necessary distance, when, lying on the sand, his eye
  glanced at the same time at the top of the pole and the crest of the cliff. He carefully
  marked the place with a little stick.</p>
- "<p>Then addressing Herbert?\u201CDo you know the first principles of geometry?\u201D\
  \ he asked.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSlightly, captain,\u201D replied Herbert, who did not wish to put himself\
  \ forward.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou remember what are the properties of two similar triangles?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Herbert; \u201Ctheir homologous sides are proportional.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, my boy, I have just constructed two similar right\u2011angled triangles;\
  \ the first, the smallest, has for its sides the perpendicular pole, the distance\
  \ which separates the little stick from the foot of the pole and my visual ray for\
  \ hypothenuse; the second has for its sides the perpendicular cliff, the height\
  \ of which we wish to measure, the distance which separates the little stick from\
  \ the bottom of the cliff, and my visual ray also forms its hypothenuse, which proves\
  \ to be prolongation of that of the first triangle.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh, captain, I understand!\u201D cried Herbert. \u201CAs the distance\
  \ from the stick to the pole is to the distance from the stick to the base of the\
  \ cliff, so is the height of the pole to the height of the cliff.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CJust so, Herbert,\u201D replied the engineer; \u201Cand when we have measured\
  \ the two first distances, knowing the height of the pole, we shall only have a\
  \ sum in proportion to do, which will give us the height of the cliff, and will\
  \ save us the trouble of measuring it directly.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The two horizontal distances were found out by means of the pole, whose length
  above the sand was exactly ten feet.</p>
- <p>The first distance was fifteen feet between the stick and the place where the
  pole was thrust into the sand.</p>
- <p>The second distance between the stick and the bottom of the cliff was five hundred
  feet.</p>
- <p>These measurements finished, Cyrus Harding and the lad returned to the Chimneys.</p>
- <p>The engineer then took a flat stone which he had brought back from one of his
  previous excursions, a sort of slate, on which it was easy to trace figures with
  a sharp shell. He then proved the following proportions:?</p>
- <p>          15:500::10:x</p>
- <p>         500 x 10 = 5000</p>
- <p>        5000 / 15 = 333.3</p>
- <p>From which it was proved that the granite cliff measured 333 feet in height.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding then took the instrument which he had made the evening before,\
  \ the space between its two legs giving the angular distance between the star Alpha\
  \ and the horizon. He measured, very exactly, the opening of this angle on a circumference\
  \ which he divided into 360 equal parts. Now, this angle by adding to it the twenty\u2011\
  seven degrees which separated Alpha from the antarctic pole, and by reducing to\
  \ the level of the sea the height of the cliff on which the observation had been\
  \ made, was found to be fifty\u2011three degrees. These fifty\u2011three degrees\
  \ being subtracted from ninety degrees?the distance from the pole to the equator?there\
  \ remained thirty\u2011seven degrees. Cyrus Harding concluded, therefore, that Lincoln\
  \ Island was situated on the thirty\u2011seventh degree of the southern latitude,\
  \ or taking into consideration through the imperfection of the performance, an error\
  \ of five degrees, that it must be situated between the thirty\u2011fifth and the\
  \ fortieth parallel.</p>"
- "<p>There was only the longitude to be obtained, and the position of the island\
  \ would be determined, The engineer hoped to attempt this the same day, at twelve\
  \ o\u2019clock, at which moment the sun would pass the meridian.</p>"
- <p>It was decided that Sunday should be spent in a walk, or rather an exploring
  expedition, to that side of the island between the north of the lake and Shark Gulf,
  and if there was time they would push their discoveries to the northern side of
  Cape South Mandible. They would breakfast on the downs, and not return till evening.</p>
- "<p>At half\u2011past eight the little band was following the edge of the channel.\
  \ On the other side, on Safety Islet, numerous birds were gravely strutting. They\
  \ were divers, easily recognized by their cry, which much resembles the braying\
  \ of a donkey. Pencroft only considered them in an eatable point of view, and learnt\
  \ with some satisfaction that their flesh, though blackish, is not bad food.</p>"
- <p>Great amphibious creatures could also be seen crawling on the sand; seals, doubtless,
  who appeared to have chosen the islet for a place of refuge. It was impossible to
  think of those animals in an alimentary point of view, for their oily flesh is detestable;
  however, Cyrus Harding observed them attentively, and without making known his idea,
  he announced to his companions that very soon they would pay a visit to the islet.
  The beach was strewn with innumerable shells, some of which would have rejoiced
  the heart of a conchologist; there were, among others, the phasianella, the terebratual,
  etc. But what would be of more use, was the discovery, by Neb, at low tide, of a
  large oysterbed among the rocks, nearly five miles from the Chimneys.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNeb will not have lost his day,\u201D cried Pencroft, looking at the spacious\
  \ oyster\u2011bed.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is really a fortunate discovery,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cand\
  \ as it is said that each oyster produces yearly from fifty to sixty thousand eggs,\
  \ we shall have an inexhaustible supply there.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COnly I believe that the oyster is not very nourishing,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Harding. \u201CThe oyster contains very little nitrogen,\
  \ and if a man lived exclusively on them, he would have to eat not less than fifteen\
  \ to sixteen dozen a day.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCapital!\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201CWe might swallow dozens and dozens\
  \ without exhausting the bed. Shall we take some for breakfast?\u201D</p>"
- <p>And without waiting for a reply to this proposal, knowing that it would be approved
  of, the sailor and Neb detached a quantity of the molluscs. They put them in a sort
  of net of hibiscus fiber, which Neb had manufactured, and which already contained
  food; they then continued to climb the coast between the downs and the sea.</p>
- <p>From time to time Harding consulted his watch, so as to be prepared in time for
  the solar observation, which had to be made exactly at midday.</p>
- "<p>All that part of the island was very barren as far as the point which closed\
  \ Union Bay, and which had received the name of Cape South Mandible. Nothing could\
  \ be seen there but sand and shells, mingled with debris of lava. A few sea\u2011\
  birds frequented this desolate coast, gulls, great albatrosses, as well as wild\
  \ duck, for which Pencroft had a great fancy. He tried to knock some over with an\
  \ arrow, but without result, for they seldom perched, and he could not hit them\
  \ on the wing.</p>"
- <p>This led the sailor to repeat to the engineer,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CYou see, captain, so long as we have not one or two fowling\u2011pieces,\
  \ we shall never get anything!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDoubtless, Pencroft,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Cbut it depends\
  \ on you. Procure us some iron for the barrels, steel for the hammers, saltpeter.\
  \ coal and sulphur for powder, mercury and nitric acid for the fulminate, and lead\
  \ for the shot, and the captain will make us first\u2011rate guns.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh!\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cwe might, no doubt, find all these\
  \ substances on the island, but a gun is a delicate instrument, and needs very particular\
  \ tools. However, we shall see later!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy,\u201D cried Pencroft, \u201Cwere we obliged to throw overboard all\
  \ the weapons we had with us in the car, all our implements, even our pocket\u2011\
  knives?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut if we had not thrown them away, Pencroft, the balloon would have thrown\
  \ us to the bottom of the sea!\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat you say is true, my boy,\u201D replied the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>Then passing to another idea,?\u201CThink,\u201D said he, \u201Chow astounded\
  \ Jonathan Forster and his companions must have been when, next morning, they found\
  \ the place empty, and the machine flown away!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am utterly indifferent about knowing what they may have thought,\u201D\
  \ said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt was all my idea, that!\u201D said Pencroft, with a satisfied air.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA splendid idea, Pencroft!\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, laughing, \u201C\
  and which has placed us where we are.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI would rather be here than in the hands of the Southerners,\u201D cried\
  \ the sailor, \u201Cespecially since the captain has been kind enough to come and\
  \ join us again.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSo would I, truly!\u201D replied the reporter. \u201CBesides, what do\
  \ we want? Nothing.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf that is not?everything!\u201D replied Pencroft, laughing and shrugging\
  \ his shoulders. \u201CBut, some day or other, we shall find means of going away!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CSooner, perhaps, than you imagine, my friends,\u201D remarked the engineer,\
  \ \u201Cif Lincoln Island is but a medium distance from an inhabited island, or\
  \ from a continent. We shall know in an hour. I have not a map of the Pacific, but\
  \ my memory has preserved a very clear recollection of its southern part. The latitude\
  \ which I obtained yesterday placed New Zealand to the west of Lincoln Island, and\
  \ the coast of Chile to the east. But between these two countries, there is a distance\
  \ of at least six thousand miles. It has, therefore, to be determined what point\
  \ in this great space the island occupies, and this the longitude will give us presently,\
  \ with a sufficient approximation, I hope.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIs not the archipelago of the Pomoutous the nearest point to us in latitude?\u201D\
  \ asked Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cbut the distance which separates\
  \ us from it is more than twelve hundred miles.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd that way?\u201D asked Neb, who followed the conversation with extreme\
  \ interest, pointing to the south.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat way, nothing,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNothing, indeed,\u201D added the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, Cyrus,\u201D asked the reporter, \u201Cif Lincoln Island is not\
  \ more than two or three thousand miles from New Zealand or Chile?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cinstead of building a house we\
  \ will build a boat, and Master Pencroft shall be put in command?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell then,\u201D cried the sailor, \u201CI am quite ready to be captain?as\
  \ soon as you can make a craft that\u2019s able to keep at sea!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall do it, if it is necessary,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- <p>But while these men, who really hesitated at nothing, were talking, the hour
  approached at which the observation was to be made. What Cyrus Harding was to do
  to ascertain the passage of the sun at the meridian of the island, without an instrument
  of any sort, Herbert could not guess.</p>
- "<p>The observers were then about six miles from the Chimneys, not far from that\
  \ part of the downs in which the engineer had been found after his enigmatical preservation.\
  \ They halted at this place and prepared for breakfast, for it was half\u2011past\
  \ eleven. Herbert went for some fresh water from a stream which ran near, and brought\
  \ it back in a jug, which Neb had provided.</p>"
- <p>During these preparations Harding arranged everything for his astronomical observation.
  He chose a clear place on the shore, which the ebbing tide had left perfectly level.
  This bed of fine sand was as smooth as ice, not a grain out of place. It was of
  little importance whether it was horizontal or not, and it did not matter much whether
  the stick six feet high, which was planted there, rose perpendicularly. On the contrary,
  the engineer inclined it towards the south, that is to say, in the direction of
  the coast opposite to the sun, for it must not be forgotten that the settlers in
  Lincoln Island, as the island was situated in the Southern Hemisphere, saw the radiant
  planet describe its diurnal arc above the northern, and not above the southern horizon.</p>
- <p>Herbert now understood how the engineer was going to proceed to ascertain the
  culmination of the sun, that is to say its passing the meridian of the island or,
  in other words, determine due south. It was by means of the shadow cast on the sand
  by the stick, a way which, for want of an instrument, would give him a suitable
  approach to the result which he wished to obtain.</p>
- "<p>In fact, the moment when this shadow would reach its minimum of length would\
  \ be exactly twelve o\u2019clock, and it would be enough to watch the extremity\
  \ of the shadow, so as to ascertain the instant when, after having successively\
  \ diminished, it began to lengthen. By inclining his stick to the side opposite\
  \ to the sun, Cyrus Harding made the shadow longer, and consequently its modifications\
  \ would be more easily ascertained. In fact, the longer the needle of a dial is,\
  \ the more easily can the movement of its point be followed. The shadow of the stick\
  \ was nothing but the needle of a dial. The moment had come, and Cyrus Harding knelt\
  \ on the sand, and with little wooden pegs, which he stuck into the sand, he began\
  \ to mark the successive diminutions of the stick\u2019s shadow. His companions,\
  \ bending over him, watched the operation with extreme interest. The reporter held\
  \ his chronometer in his hand, ready to tell the hour which it marked when the shadow\
  \ would be at its shortest. Moreover, as Cyrus Harding was working on the 16th of\
  \ April, the day on which the true and the average time are identical, the hour\
  \ given by Gideon Spilett would be the true hour then at Washington, which would\
  \ simplify the calculation. Meanwhile as the sun slowly advanced, the shadow slowly\
  \ diminished, and when it appeared to Cyrus Harding that it was beginning to increase,\
  \ he asked, \u201CWhat o\u2019clock is it?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COne minute past five,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett directly. They had\
  \ now only to calculate the operation. Nothing could be easier. It could be seen\
  \ that there existed, in round numbers, a difference of five hours between the meridian\
  \ of Washington and that of Lincoln Island, that is to say, it was midday in Lincoln\
  \ Island when it was already five o\u2019clock in the evening in Washington. Now\
  \ the sun, in its apparent movement round the earth, traverses one degree in four\
  \ minutes, or fifteen degrees an hour. Fifteen degrees multiplied by five hours\
  \ give seventy\u2011five degrees.</p>"
- "<p>Then, since Washington is 77deg 3\u2019 11\u201D as much as to say seventy\u2011\
  seven degrees counted from the meridian of Greenwich which the Americans take for\
  \ their starting\u2011point for longitudes concurrently with the English?it followed\
  \ that the island must be situated seventy\u2011seven and seventy\u2011five degrees\
  \ west of the meridian of Greenwich, that is to say, on the hundred and fifty\u2011\
  second degree of west longitude.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding announced this result to his companions, and taking into consideration\
  \ errors of observation, as he had done for the latitude, he believed he could positively\
  \ affirm that the position of Lincoln Island was between the thirty\u2011fifth and\
  \ the thirty\u2011seventh parallel, and between the hundred and fiftieth and the\
  \ hundred and fifty\u2011fifth meridian to the west of the meridian of Greenwich.</p>"
- <p>The possible fault which he attributed to errors in the observation was, it may
  be seen, of five degrees on both sides, which, at sixty miles to a degree, would
  give an error of three hundred miles in latitude and longitude for the exact position.</p>
- <p>But this error would not influence the determination which it was necessary to
  take. It was very evident that Lincoln Island was at such a distance from every
  country or island that it would be too hazardous to attempt to reach one in a frail
  boat.</p>
- <p>In fact, this calculation placed it at least twelve hundred miles from Tahiti
  and the islands of the archipelago of the Pomoutous, more than eighteen hundred
  miles from New Zealand, and more than four thousand five hundred miles from the
  American coast!</p>
- <p>And when Cyrus Harding consulted his memory, he could not remember in any way
  that such an island occupied, in that part of the Pacific, the situation assigned
  to Lincoln Island.</p>
- <p>Chapter 15</p>
- "<p>The next day, the 17th of April, the sailor\u2019s first words were addressed\
  \ to Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, sir,\u201D he asked, \u201Cwhat shall we do to\u2011day?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat the captain pleases,\u201D replied the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>Till then the engineer\u2019s companions had been brickmakers and potters, now\
  \ they were to become metallurgists.</p>"
- <p>The day before, after breakfast, they had explored as far as the point of Mandible
  Cape, seven miles distant from the Chimneys. There, the long series of downs ended,
  and the soil had a volcanic appearance. There were no longer high cliffs as at Prospect
  Heights, but a strange and capricious border which surrounded the narrow gulf between
  the two capes, formed of mineral matter, thrown up by the volcano. Arrived at this
  point the settlers retraced their steps, and at nightfall entered the Chimneys;
  but they did not sleep before the question of knowing whether they could think of
  leaving Lincoln Island or not was definitely settled.</p>
- <p>The twelve hundred miles which separated the island from the Pomoutous Island
  was a considerable distance. A boat could not cross it, especially at the approach
  of the bad season. Pencroft had expressly declared this. Now, to construct a simple
  boat even with the necessary tools, was a difficult work, and the colonists not
  having tools they must begin by making hammers, axes, adzes, saws, augers, planes,
  etc., which would take some time. It was decided, therefore, that they would winter
  at Lincoln Island, and that they would look for a more comfortable dwelling than
  the Chimneys, in which to pass the winter months.</p>
- <p>Before anything else could be done it was necessary to make the iron ore, of
  which the engineer had observed some traces in the northwest part of the island,
  fit for use by converting it either into iron or into steel.</p>
- <p>Metals are not generally found in the ground in a pure state. For the most part
  they are combined with oxygen or sulphur. Such was the case with the two specimens
  which Cyrus Harding had brought back, one of magnetic iron, not carbonated, the
  other a pyrite, also called sulphuret of iron. It was, therefore the first, the
  oxide of iron, which they must reduce with coal, that is to say, get rid of the
  oxygen, to obtain it in a pure state. This reduction is made by subjecting the ore
  with coal to a high temperature, either by the rapid and easy Catalan method, which
  has the advantage of transforming the ore into iron in a single operation, or by
  the blast furnace, which first smelts the ore, then changes it into iron, by carrying
  away the three to four per cent. of coal, which is combined with it.</p>
- <p>Now Cyrus Harding wanted iron, and he wished to obtain it as soon as possible.
  The ore which he had picked up was in itself very pure and rich. It was the oxydulous
  iron, which is found in confused masses of a deep gray color; it gives a black dust,
  crystallized in the form of the regular octahedron. Native lodestones consist of
  this ore, and iron of the first quality is made in Europe from that with which Sweden
  and Norway are so abundantly supplied. Not far from this vein was the vein of coal
  already made use of by the settlers. The ingredients for the manufacture being close
  together would greatly facilitate the treatment of the ore. This is the cause of
  the wealth of the mines in Great Britain, where the coal aids the manufacture of
  the metal extracted from the same soil at the same time as itself.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThen, captain,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cwe are going to work iron ore?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, my friend,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cand for that?something\
  \ which will please you?we must begin by having a seal hunt on the islet.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CA seal hunt!\u201D cried the sailor, turning towards Gideon Spilett. \u201C\
  Are seals needed to make iron?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSince Cyrus has said so!\u201D replied the reporter.</p>"
- <p>But the engineer had already left the Chimneys, and Pencroft prepared for the
  seal hunt, without having received any other explanation.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding, Herbert, Gideon Spilett, Neb, and the sailor were soon collected
  on the shore, at a place where the channel left a ford passable at low tide. The
  hunters could therefore traverse it without getting wet higher than the knee.</p>
- <p>Harding then put his foot on the islet for the first, and his companions for
  the second time.</p>
- "<p>On their landing some hundreds of penguins looked fearlessly at them. The hunters,\
  \ armed with sticks, could have killed them easily, but they were not guilty of\
  \ such useless massacre, as it was important not to frighten the seals, who were\
  \ lying on the sand several cable lengths off. They also respected certain innocent\u2011\
  looking birds, whose wings were reduced to the state of stumps, spread out like\
  \ fins, ornamented with feathers of a scaly appearance. The settlers, therefore,\
  \ prudently advanced towards the north point, walking over ground riddled with little\
  \ holes, which formed nests for the sea\u2011birds. Towards the extremity of the\
  \ islet appeared great black heads floating just above the water, having exactly\
  \ the appearance of rocks in motion.</p>"
- <p>These were the seals which were to be captured. It was necessary, however, first
  to allow them to land, for with their close, short hair, and their fusiform conformation,
  being excellent swimmers, it is difficult to catch them in the sea, while on land
  their short, webbed feet prevent their having more than a slow, waddling movement.</p>
- <p>Pencroft knew the habits of these creatures, and he advised waiting till they
  were stretched on the sand, when the sun, before long, would send them to sleep.
  They must then manage to cut off their retreat and knock them on the head.</p>
- <p>The hunters, having concealed themselves behind the rocks, waited silently.</p>
- <p>An hour passed before the seals came to play on the sand. They could count half
  a dozen. Pencroft and Herbert then went round the point of the islet, so as to take
  them in the rear, and cut off their retreat. During this time Cyrus Harding, Spilett,
  and Neb, crawling behind the rocks, glided towards the future scene of combat.</p>
- <p>All at once the tall figure of the sailor appeared. Pencroft shouted. The engineer
  and his two companions threw themselves between the sea and the seals. Two of the
  animals soon lay dead on the sand, but the rest regained the sea in safety.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHere are the seals required, captain!\u201D said the sailor, advancing\
  \ towards the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCapital,\u201D replied Harding. \u201CWe will make bellows of them!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CBellows!\u201D cried Pencroft. \u201CWell! these are lucky seals!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>It was, in fact, a blowing\u2011machine, necessary for the treatment of the\
  \ ore that the engineer wished to manufacture with the skins of the amphibious creatures.\
  \ They were of a medium size, for their length did not exceed six feet. They resembled\
  \ a dog about the head.</p>"
- <p>As it was useless to burden themselves with the weight of both the animals, Neb
  and Pencroft resolved to skin them on the spot, while Cyrus Harding and the reporter
  continued to explore the islet.</p>
- "<p>The sailor and the Negro cleverly performed the operation, and three hours afterwards\
  \ Cyrus Harding had at his disposal two seals\u2019 skins, which he intended to\
  \ use in this state, without subjecting them to any tanning process.</p>"
- <p>The settlers waited till the tide was again low, and crossing the channel they
  entered the Chimneys.</p>
- "<p>The skins had then to be stretched on a frame of wood and sewn by means of fibers\
  \ so as to preserve the air without allowing too much to escape. Cyrus Harding had\
  \ nothing but the two steel blades from Top\u2019s collar, and yet he was so clever,\
  \ and his companions aided him with so much intelligence, that three days afterwards\
  \ the little colony\u2019s stock of tools was augmented by a blowing\u2011machine,\
  \ destined to inject the air into the midst of the ore when it should be subjected\
  \ to heat?an indispensable condition to the success of the operation.</p>"
- "<p>On the morning of the 20th of April began the \u201Cmetallic period,\u201D as\
  \ the reporter called it in his notes. The engineer had decided, as has been said,\
  \ to operate near the veins both of coal and ore. Now, according to his observations,\
  \ these veins were situated at the foot of the northeast spurs of Mount Franklin,\
  \ that is to say, a distance of six miles from their home. It was impossible, therefore,\
  \ to return every day to the Chimneys, and it was agreed that the little colony\
  \ should camp under a hut of branches, so that the important operation could be\
  \ followed night and day.</p>"
- <p>This settled, they set out in the morning. Neb and Pencroft dragged the bellows
  on a hurdle; also a quantity of vegetables and animals, which they besides could
  renew on the way.</p>
- "<p>The road led through Jacamar Wood, which they traversed obliquely from southeast\
  \ to northwest, and in the thickest part. It was necessary to beat a path, which\
  \ would in the future form the most direct road to Prospect Heights and Mount Franklin.\
  \ The trees, belonging to the species already discovered, were magnificent. Herbert\
  \ found some new ones, among others some which Pencroft called \u201Csham leeks\u201D\
  ; for, in spite of their size, they were of the same liliaceous family as the onion,\
  \ chive, shallot, or asparagus. These trees produce ligneous roots which, when cooked,\
  \ are excellent; from them, by fermentation, a very agreeable liquor is made. They\
  \ therefore made a good store of the roots.</p>"
- "<p>The journey through the wood was long; it lasted the whole day, and so allowed\
  \ plenty of time for examining the flora and fauna. Top, who took special charge\
  \ of the fauna, ran through the grass and brushwood, putting up all sorts of game.\
  \ Herbert and Gideon Spilett killed two kangaroos with bows and arrows, and also\
  \ an animal which strongly resembled both a hedgehog and an ant\u2011eater. It was\
  \ like the first because it rolled itself into a ball, and bristled with spines,\
  \ and the second because it had sharp claws, a long slender snout which terminated\
  \ in a bird\u2019s beak, and an extendible tongue, covered with little thorns which\
  \ served to hold the insects.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd when it is in the pot,\u201D asked Pencroft naturally, \u201Cwhat\
  \ will it be like?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAn excellent piece of beef,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe will not ask more from it,\u201D replied the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>During this excursion they saw several wild boars, which however, did not offer\
  \ to attack the little band, and it appeared as if they would not meet with any\
  \ dangerous beasts; when, in a thick part of the wood, the reporter thought he saw,\
  \ some paces from him, among the lower branches of a tree, an animal which he took\
  \ for a bear, and which he very tranquilly began to draw. Happily for Gideon Spilett,\
  \ the animal in question did not belong to the redoubtable family of the plantigrades.\
  \ It was only a koala, better known under the name of the sloth, being about the\
  \ size of a large dog, and having stiff hair of a dirty color, the paws armed with\
  \ strong claws, which enabled it to climb trees and feed on the leaves. Having identified\
  \ the animal, which they did not disturb, Gideon Spilett erased \u201Cbear\u201D\
  \ from the title of his sketch, putting koala in its place, and the journey was\
  \ resumed.</p>"
- "<p>At five o\u2019clock in the evening, Cyrus Harding gave the signal to halt.\
  \ They were now outside the forest, at the beginning of the powerful spurs which\
  \ supported Mount Franklin towards the west. At a distance of some hundred feet\
  \ flowed the Red Creek, and consequently plenty of fresh water was within their\
  \ reach.</p>"
- "<p>The camp was soon organized. In less than an hour, on the edge of the forest,\
  \ among the trees, a hut of branches interlaced with creepers, and pasted over with\
  \ clay, offered a tolerable shelter. Their geological researches were put off till\
  \ the next day. Supper was prepared, a good fire blazed before the hut, the roast\
  \ turned, and at eight o\u2019clock, while one of the settlers watched to keep up\
  \ the fire, in case any wild beasts should prowl in the neighborhood, the others\
  \ slept soundly.</p>"
- <p>The next day, the 21st of April, Cyrus Harding accompanied by Herbert, went to
  look for the soil of ancient formation, on which he had already discovered a specimen
  of ore. They found the vein above ground, near the source of the creek, at the foot
  of one of the northeastern spurs. This ore, very rich in iron, enclosed in its fusible
  veinstone, was perfectly suited to the mode of reduction which the engineer intended
  to employ; that is, the Catalan method, but simplified, as it is used in Corsica.
  In fact, the Catalan method, properly so called, requires the construction of kilns
  and crucibles, in which the ore and the coal, placed in alternate layers, are transformed
  and reduced, But Cyrus Harding intended to economize these constructions, and wished
  simply to form, with the ore and the coal, a cubic mass, to the center of which
  he would direct the wind from his bellows. Doubtless, it was the proceeding employed
  by Tubalcain, and the first metallurgists of the inhabited world. Now that which
  had succeeded with the grandson of Adam, and which still yielded good results in
  countries rich in ore and fuel, could not but succeed with the settlers in Lincoln
  Island.</p>
- "<p>The coal, as well as the ore, was collected without trouble on the surface of\
  \ the ground. They first broke the ore into little pieces, and cleansed them with\
  \ the hand from the impurities which soiled their surface. Then coal and ore were\
  \ arranged in heaps and in successive layers, as the charcoal\u2011burner does with\
  \ the wood which he wishes to carbonize. In this way, under the influence of the\
  \ air projected by the blowing\u2011machine, the coal would be transformed into\
  \ carbonic acid, then into oxide of carbon, its use being to reduce the oxide of\
  \ iron, that is to say, to rid it of the oxygen.</p>"
- <p>Thus the engineer proceeded. The bellows of sealskin, furnished at its extremity
  with a nozzle of clay, which had been previously fabricated in the pottery kiln,
  was established near the heap of ore. Using the mechanism which consisted of a frame,
  cords of fiber and counterpoise, he threw into the mass an abundance of air, which
  by raising the temperature also concurred with the chemical transformation to produce
  in time pure iron.</p>
- <p>The operation was difficult. All the patience, all the ingenuity of the settlers
  was needed; but at last it succeeded, and the result was a lump of iron, reduced
  to a spongy state, which it was necessary to shingle and fagot, that is to say,
  to forge so as to expel from it the liquefied veinstone. These amateur smiths had,
  of course, no hammer; but they were in no worse a situation than the first metallurgist,
  and therefore did what, no doubt, he had to do.</p>
- <p>A handle was fixed to the first lump, and was used as a hammer to forge the second
  on a granite anvil, and thus they obtained a coarse but useful metal. At length,
  after many trials and much fatigue, on the 25th of April several bars of iron were
  forged, and transformed into tools, crowbars, pincers, pickaxes, spades, etc., which
  Pencroft and Neb declared to be real jewels. But the metal was not yet in its most
  serviceable state, that is, of steel. Now steel is a combination of iron and coal,
  which is extracted, either from the liquid ore, by taking from it the excess of
  coal, or from the iron by adding to it the coal which was wanting. The first, obtained
  by the decarburation of the metal, gives natural or puddled steel; the second, produced
  by the carburation of the iron, gives steel of cementation.</p>
- <p>It was the last which Cyrus Harding intended to forge, as he possessed iron in
  a pure state. He succeeded by heating the metal with powdered coal in a crucible
  which had previously been manufactured from clay suitable for the purpose.</p>
- "<p>He then worked this steel, which is malleable both when hot or cold, with the\
  \ hammer. Neb and Pencroft, cleverly directed, made hatchets, which, heated red\u2011\
  hot, and plunged suddenly into cold water, acquired an excellent temper.</p>"
- <p>Other instruments, of course roughly fashioned, were also manufactured; blades
  for planes, axes, hatchets, pieces of steel to be transformed into saws, chisels;
  then iron for spades, pickaxes, hammers, nails, etc. At last, on the 5th of May,
  the metallic period ended, the smiths returned to the Chimneys, and new work would
  soon authorize them to take a fresh title.</p>
- <p>Chapter 16</p>
- "<p>It was the 6th of May, a day which corresponds to the 6th of November in the\
  \ countries of the Northern Hemisphere. The sky had been obscured for some days,\
  \ and it was of importance to make preparations for the winter. However, the temperature\
  \ was not as yet much lower, and a centigrade thermometer, transported to Lincoln\
  \ Island, would still have marked an average of ten to twelve degrees above zero.\
  \ This was not surprising, since Lincoln Island, probably situated between the thirty\u2011\
  fifth and fortieth parallel, would be subject, in the Southern Hemisphere, to the\
  \ same climate as Sicily or Greece in the Northern Hemisphere. But as Greece and\
  \ Sicily have severe cold, producing snow and ice, so doubtless would Lincoln Island\
  \ in the severest part of the winter and it was advisable to provide against it.</p>"
- "<p>In any case if cold did not yet threaten them, the rainy season would begin,\
  \ and on this lonely island, exposed to all the fury of the elements, in mid\u2011\
  ocean, bad weather would be frequent, and probably terrible. The question of a more\
  \ comfortable dwelling than the Chimneys must therefore be seriously considered\
  \ and promptly resolved on.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft, naturally, had some predilection for the retreat which he had discovered,
  but he well understood that another must be found. The Chimneys had been already
  visited by the sea, under circumstances which are known, and it would not do to
  be exposed again to a similar accident.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBesides,\u201D added Cyrus Harding, who this day was talking of these\
  \ things with his companions, \u201Cwe have some precautions to take.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy? The island is not inhabited,\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is probable,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Calthough we have not\
  \ yet explored the interior; but if no human beings are found, I fear that dangerous\
  \ animals may abound. It is necessary to guard against a possible attack, so that\
  \ we shall not be obliged to watch every night, or to keep up a fire. And then,\
  \ my friends, we must foresee everything. We are here in a part of the Pacific often\
  \ frequented by Malay pirates?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat!\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cat such a distance from land?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, my boy,\u201D replied the engineer. \u201CThese pirates are bold\
  \ sailors as well as formidable enemies, and we must take measures accordingly.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cwe will fortify ourselves against\
  \ savages with two legs as well as against savages with four. But, captain, will\
  \ it not be best to explore every part of the island before undertaking anything\
  \ else?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat would be best,\u201D added Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho knows if we might not find on the opposite side one of the caverns\
  \ which we have searched for in vain here?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is true,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cbut you forget, my friends,\
  \ that it will be necessary to establish ourselves in the neighborhood of a watercourse,\
  \ and that, from the summit of Mount Franklin, we could not see towards the west,\
  \ either stream or river. Here, on the contrary, we are placed between the Mercy\
  \ and Lake Grant, an advantage which must not be neglected. And, besides, this side,\
  \ looking towards the east, is not exposed as the other is to the trade\u2011winds,\
  \ which in this hemisphere blow from the northwest.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen, captain,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Clet us build a house on\
  \ the edge of the lake. Neither bricks nor tools are wanting now. After having been\
  \ brickmakers, potters, smelters, and smiths, we shall surely know how to be masons!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, my friend; but before coming to any decision we must consider the\
  \ matter thoroughly. A natural dwelling would spare us much work, and would be a\
  \ surer retreat, for it would be as well defended against enemies from the interior\
  \ as those from outside.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is true, Cyrus,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Cbut we have already\
  \ examined all that mass of granite, and there is not a hole, not a cranny!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, not one!\u201D added Pencroft. \u201CAh, if we were able to dig out\
  \ a dwelling in that cliff, at a good height, so as to be out of the reach of harm,\
  \ that would be capital! I can see that on the front which looks seaward, five or\
  \ six rooms?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWith windows to light them!\u201D said Herbert, laughing.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd a staircase to climb up to them!\u201D added Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are laughing,\u201D cried the sailor, \u201Cand why? What is there\
  \ impossible in what I propose? Haven\u2019t we got pickaxes and spades? Won\u2019\
  t Captain Harding be able to make powder to blow up the mine? Isn\u2019t it true,\
  \ captain, that you will make powder the very day we want it?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding listened to the enthusiastic Pencroft developing his fanciful projects.
  To attack this mass of granite, even by a mine, was Herculean work, and it was really
  vexing that nature could not help them at their need. But the engineer did not reply
  to the sailor except by proposing to examine the cliff more attentively, from the
  mouth of the river to the angle which terminated it on the north.</p>
- <p>They went out, therefore, and the exploration was made with extreme care, over
  an extent of nearly two miles. But in no place in the bare, straight cliff, could
  any cavity be found. The nests of the rock pigeons which fluttered at its summit
  were only, in reality, holes bored at the very top, and on the irregular edge of
  the granite.</p>
- <p>It was a provoking circumstance, and as to attacking this cliff, either with
  pickaxe or with powder, so as to effect a sufficient excavation, it was not to be
  thought of. It so happened that, on all this part of the shore, Pencroft had discovered
  the only habitable shelter, that is to say, the Chimneys, which now had to be abandoned.</p>
- "<p>The exploration ended, the colonists found themselves at the north angle of\
  \ the cliff, where it terminated in long slopes which died away on the shore. From\
  \ this place, to its extreme limit in the west, it only formed a sort of declivity,\
  \ a thick mass of stones, earth, and sand, bound together by plants, bushes, and\
  \ grass inclined at an angle of only forty\u2011five degrees. Clumps of trees grew\
  \ on these slopes, which were also carpeted with thick grass. But the vegetation\
  \ did not extend far, and a long, sandy plain, which began at the foot of these\
  \ slopes, reached to the beach.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding thought, not without reason, that the overplus of the lake must
  overflow on this side. The excess of water furnished by the Red Creek must also
  escape by some channel or other. Now the engineer had not yet found this channel
  on any part of the shore already explored, that is to say, from the mouth of the
  stream on the west of Prospect Heights.</p>
- <p>The engineer now proposed to his companions to climb the slope, and to return
  to the Chimneys by the heights, while exploring the northern and eastern shores
  of the lake. The proposal was accepted, and in a few minutes Herbert and Neb were
  on the upper plateau. Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft followed with
  more sedate steps.</p>
- <p>The beautiful sheet of water glittered through the trees under the rays of the
  sun. In this direction the country was charming. The eye feasted on the groups of
  trees. Some old trunks, bent with age, showed black against the verdant grass which
  covered the ground. Crowds of brilliant cockatoos screamed among the branches, moving
  prisms, hopping from one bough to another.</p>
- <p>The settlers instead of going directly to the north bank of the lake, made a
  circuit round the edge of the plateau, so as to join the mouth of the creek on its
  left bank. It was a detour of more than a mile and a half. Walking was easy, for
  the trees widely spread, left a considerable space between them. The fertile zone
  evidently stopped at this point, and vegetation would be less vigorous in the part
  between the course of the Creek and the Mercy.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions walked over this new ground with great care.
  Bows, arrows, and sticks with sharp iron points were their only weapons. However,
  no wild beast showed itself, and it was probable that these animals frequented rather
  the thick forests in the south; but the settlers had the disagreeable surprise of
  seeing Top stop before a snake of great size, measuring from fourteen to fifteen
  feet in length. Neb killed it by a blow from his stick. Cyrus Harding examined the
  reptile, and declared it not venomous, for it belonged to that species of diamond
  serpents which the natives of New South Wales rear. But it was possible that others
  existed whose bite was mortal such as the deaf vipers with forked tails, which rise
  up under the feet, or those winged snakes, furnished with two ears, which enable
  them to proceed with great rapidity. Top, the first moment of surprise over, began
  a reptile chase with such eagerness, that they feared for his safety. His master
  called him back directly.</p>
- <p>The mouth of the Red Creek, at the place where it entered into the lake, was
  soon reached. The explorers recognized on the opposite shore the point which they
  had visited on their descent from Mount Franklin. Cyrus Harding ascertained that
  the flow of water into it from the creek was considerable. Nature must therefore
  have provided some place for the escape of the overplus. This doubtless formed a
  fall, which, if it could be discovered, would be of great use.</p>
- "<p>The colonists, walking apart, but not straying far from each other, began to\
  \ skirt the edge of the lake, which was very steep. The water appeared to be full\
  \ of fish, and Pencroft resolved to make some fishing\u2011rods, so as to try and\
  \ catch some.</p>"
- <p>The northeast point was first to be doubled. It might have been supposed that
  the discharge of water was at this place, for the extremity of the lake was almost
  on a level with the edge of the plateau. But no signs of this were discovered, and
  the colonists continued to explore the bank, which, after a slight bend, descended
  parallel to the shore.</p>
- "<p>On this side the banks were less woody, but clumps of trees, here and there,\
  \ added to the picturesqueness of the country. Lake Grant was viewed from thence\
  \ in all its extent, and no breath disturbed the surface of its waters. Top, in\
  \ beating the bushes, put up flocks of birds of different kinds, which Gideon Spilett\
  \ and Herbert saluted with arrows. One was hit by the lad, and fell into some marshy\
  \ grass. Top rushed forward, and brought a beautiful swimming bird, of a slate color,\
  \ short beak, very developed frontal plate, and wings edged with white. It was a\
  \ \u201Ccoot,\u201D the size of a large partridge, belonging to the group of macrodactyls\
  \ which form the transition between the order of wading birds and that of palmipeds.\
  \ Sorry game, in truth, and its flavor is far from pleasant. But Top was not so\
  \ particular in these things as his masters, and it was agreed that the coot should\
  \ be for his supper.</p>"
- <p>The settlers were now following the eastern bank of the lake, and they would
  not be long in reaching the part which they already knew. The engineer was much
  surprised at not seeing any indication of the discharge of water. The reporter and
  the sailor talked with him, and he could not conceal his astonishment.</p>
- <p>At this moment Top, who had been very quiet till then, gave signs of agitation.
  The intelligent animal went backwards and forwards on the shore, stopped suddenly,
  and looked at the water, one paw raised, as if he was pointing at some invisible
  game; then he barked furiously, and was suddenly silent.</p>
- "<p>Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions had at first paid any attention to\
  \ Top\u2019s behavior; but the dog\u2019s barking soon became so frequent that the\
  \ engineer noticed it.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is there, Top?\u201D he asked.</p>"
- <p>The dog bounded towards his master, seeming to be very uneasy, and then rushed
  again towards the bank. Then, all at once, he plunged into the lake.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHere, Top!\u201D cried Cyrus Harding, who did not like his dog to venture\
  \ into the treacherous water.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat\u2019s happening down there?\u201D asked Pencroft, examining the\
  \ surface of the lake.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTop smells some amphibious creature,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAn alligator, perhaps,\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI do not think so,\u201D replied Harding. \u201CAlligators are only met\
  \ with in regions less elevated in latitude.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Meanwhile Top had returned at his master\u2019s call, and had regained the shore:\
  \ but he could not stay quiet; he plunged in among the tall grass, and guided by\
  \ instinct, he appeared to follow some invisible being which was slipping along\
  \ under the surface of the water. However the water was calm; not a ripple disturbed\
  \ its surface. Several times the settlers stopped on the bank, and observed it attentively.\
  \ Nothing appeared. There was some mystery there.</p>"
- <p>The engineer was puzzled.</p>
- "<p>\u201CLet us pursue this exploration to the end,\u201D said he.</p>"
- "<p>Half an hour after they had all arrived at the southeast angle of the lake,\
  \ on Prospect Heights. At this point the examination of the banks of the lake was\
  \ considered finished, and yet the engineer had not been able to discover how and\
  \ where the waters were discharged. \u201CThere is no doubt this overflow exists,\u201D\
  \ he repeated, \u201Cand since it is not visible it must go through the granite\
  \ cliff at the west!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut what importance do you attach to knowing that, my dear Cyrus?\u201D\
  \ asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CConsiderable importance,\u201D replied the engineer; \u201Cfor if it flows\
  \ through the cliff there is probably some cavity, which it would be easy to render\
  \ habitable after turning away the water.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut is it not possible, captain, that the water flows away at the bottom\
  \ of the lake,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cand that it reaches the sea by some subterranean\
  \ passage?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat might be,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cand should it be so we\
  \ shall be obliged to build our house ourselves, since nature has not done it for\
  \ us.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to return to the Chimneys,
  when Top gave new signs of agitation. He barked with fury, and before his master
  could restrain him, he had plunged a second time into the lake.</p>
- <p>All ran towards the bank. The dog was already more than twenty feet off, and
  Cyrus was calling him back, when an enormous head emerged from the water, which
  did not appear to be deep in that place.</p>
- <p>Herbert recognized directly the species of amphibian to which the tapering head,
  with large eyes, and adorned with long silky mustaches, belonged.</p>
- "<p>\u201CA lamantin!\u201D he cried.</p>"
- "<p>It was not a lamantin, but one of that species of the order of cetaceans, which\
  \ bear the name of the \u201Cdugong,\u201D for its nostrils were open at the upper\
  \ part of its snout. The enormous animal rushed on the dog, who tried to escape\
  \ by returning towards the shore. His master could do nothing to save him, and before\
  \ Gideon Spilett or Herbert thought of bending their bows, Top, seized by the dugong,\
  \ had disappeared beneath the water.</p>"
- "<p>Neb, his iron\u2011tipped spear in his hand, wished to go to Top\u2019s help,\
  \ and attack the dangerous animal in its own element.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Neb,\u201D said the engineer, restraining his courageous servant.</p>"
- <p>Meanwhile, a struggle was going on beneath the water, an inexplicable struggle,
  for in his situation Top could not possibly resist; and judging by the bubbling
  of the surface it must be also a terrible struggle, and could not but terminate
  in the death of the dog! But suddenly, in the middle of a foaming circle, Top reappeared.
  Thrown in the air by some unknown power, he rose ten feet above the surface of the
  lake, fell again into the midst of the agitated waters, and then soon gained the
  shore, without any severe wounds, miraculously saved.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions could not understand it. What was not less inexplicable
  was that the struggle still appeared to be going on. Doubtless, the dugong, attacked
  by some powerful animal, after having released the dog, was fighting on its own
  account. But it did not last long. The water became red with blood, and the body
  of the dugong, emerging from the sheet of scarlet which spread around, soon stranded
  on a little beach at the south angle of the lake. The colonists ran towards it.
  The dugong was dead. It was an enormous animal, fifteen or sixteen feet long, and
  must have weighed from three to four thousand pounds. At its neck was a wound, which
  appeared to have been produced by a sharp blade.</p>
- <p>What could the amphibious creature have been, who, by this terrible blow had
  destroyed the formidable dugong? No one could tell, and much interested in this
  incident, Harding and his companions returned to the Chimneys.</p>
- <p>Chapter 17</p>
- <p>The next day, the 7th of May, Harding and Gideon Spilett, leaving Neb to prepare
  breakfast, climbed Prospect Heights, while Herbert and Pencroft ascended by the
  river, to renew their store of wood.</p>
- "<p>The engineer and the reporter soon reached the little beach on which the dugong\
  \ had been stranded. Already flocks of birds had attacked the mass of flesh, and\
  \ had to be driven away with stones, for Cyrus wished to keep the fat for the use\
  \ of the colony. As to the animal\u2019s flesh it would furnish excellent food,\
  \ for in the islands of the Malay Archipelago and elsewhere, it is especially reserved\
  \ for the table of the native princes. But that was Neb\u2019s affair.</p>"
- <p>At this moment Cyrus Harding had other thoughts. He was much interested in the
  incident of the day before. He wished to penetrate the mystery of that submarine
  combat, and to ascertain what monster could have given the dugong so strange a wound.
  He remained at the edge of the lake, looking, observing; but nothing appeared under
  the tranquil waters, which sparkled in the first rays of the rising sun.</p>
- <p>At the beach, on which lay the body of the dugong, the water was tolerably shallow,
  but from this point the bottom of the lake sloped gradually, and it was probable
  that the depth was considerable in the center. The lake might be considered as a
  large center basin, which was filled by the water from the Red Creek.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, Cyrus,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cthere seems to be nothing\
  \ suspicious in this water.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, my dear Spilett,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cand I really do\
  \ not know how to account for the incident of yesterday.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI acknowledge,\u201D returned Spilett, \u201Cthat the wound given this\
  \ creature is, at least, very strange, and I cannot explain either how Top was so\
  \ vigorously cast up out of the water. One could have thought that a powerful arm\
  \ hurled him up, and that the same arm with a dagger killed the dugong!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied the engineer, who had become thoughtful; \u201Cthere\
  \ is something there that I cannot understand. But do you better understand either,\
  \ my dear Spilett, in what way I was saved myself?how I was drawn from the waves,\
  \ and carried to the downs? No! Is it not true? Now, I feel sure that there is some\
  \ mystery there, which, doubtless, we shall discover some day. Let us observe, but\
  \ do not dwell on these singular incidents before our companions. Let us keep our\
  \ remarks to ourselves, and continue our work.\u201D</p>"
- <p>It will be remembered that the engineer had not as yet been able to discover
  the place where the surplus water escaped, but he knew it must exist somewhere.
  He was much surprised to see a strong current at this place. By throwing in some
  bits of wood he found that it set towards the southern angle. He followed the current,
  and arrived at the south point of the lake.</p>
- <p>There was there a sort of depression in the water, as if it was suddenly lost
  in some fissure in the ground.</p>
- <p>Harding listened; placing his ear to the level of the lake, he very distinctly
  heard the noise of a subterranean fall.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThere,\u201D said he, rising, \u201Cis the discharge of the water; there,\
  \ doubtless, by a passage in the granite cliff, it joins the sea, through cavities\
  \ which we can use to our profit. Well, I can find it!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The engineer cut a long branch, stripped it of its leaves, and plunging it into\
  \ the angle between the two banks, he found that there was a large hole one foot\
  \ only beneath the surface of the water. This hole was the opening so long looked\
  \ for in vain, and the force of the current was such that the branch was torn from\
  \ the engineer\u2019s hands and disappeared.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere is no doubt about it now,\u201D repeated Harding. \u201CThere is\
  \ the outlet, and I will lay it open to view!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHow?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBy lowering the level of the water of the lake three feet.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd how will you lower the level?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBy opening another outlet larger than this.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt what place, Cyrus?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt the part of the bank nearest the coast.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut it is a mass of granite!\u201D observed Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201CI will blow up the granite, and\
  \ the water escaping, will subside, so as to lay bare this opening?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd make a waterfall, by falling on to the beach,\u201D added the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA fall that we shall make use of!\u201D replied Cyrus. \u201CCome, come!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The engineer hurried away his companion, whose confidence in Harding was such
  that he did not doubt the enterprise would succeed. And yet, how was this granite
  wall to be opened without powder, and with imperfect instruments? Was not this work
  upon which the engineer was so bent above their strength?</p>
- <p>When Harding and the reporter entered the Chimneys, they found Herbert and Pencroft
  unloading their raft of wood.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe woodmen have just finished, captain.\u201D said the sailor, laughing,\
  \ \u201Cand when you want masons?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMasons,?no, but chemists,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D added the reporter, \u201Cwe are going to blow up the island?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CBlow up the island?\u201D cried Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPart of it, at least,\u201D replied Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CListen to me, my friends,\u201D said the engineer. And he made known to\
  \ them the result of his observations.</p>"
- <p>According to him, a cavity, more or less considerable, must exist in the mass
  of granite which supported Prospect Heights, and he intended to penetrate into it.
  To do this, the opening through which the water rushed must first be cleared, and
  the level lowered by making a larger outlet. Therefore an explosive substance must
  be manufactured, which would make a deep trench in some other part of the shore.
  This was what Harding was going to attempt with the minerals which nature placed
  at his disposal.</p>
- "<p>It is useless to say with what enthusiasm all, especially Pencroft, received\
  \ this project. To employ great means, open the granite, create a cascade, that\
  \ suited the sailor. And he would just as soon be a chemist as a mason or bootmaker,\
  \ since the engineer wanted chemicals. He would be all that they liked, \u201Ceven\
  \ a professor of dancing and deportment,\u201D said he to Neb, if that was ever\
  \ necessary.</p>"
- <p>Neb and Pencroft were first of all told to extract the grease from the dugong,
  and to keep the flesh, which was destined for food. Such perfect confidence had
  they in the engineer, that they set out directly, without even asking a question.
  A few minutes after them, Cyrus Harding, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, dragging the
  hurdle, went towards the vein of coals, where those shistose pyrites abound which
  are met with in the most recent transition soil, and of which Harding had already
  found a specimen. All the day being employed in carrying a quantity of these stones
  to the Chimneys, by evening they had several tons.</p>
- <p>The next day, the 8th of May, the engineer began his manipulations. These shistose
  pyrites being composed principally of coal, flint, alumina, and sulphuret of iron?the
  latter in excess?it was necessary to separate the sulphuret of iron, and transform
  it into sulphate as rapidly as possible. The sulphate obtained, the sulphuric acid
  could then be extracted.</p>
- <p>This was the object to be attained. Sulphuric acid is one of the agents the most
  frequently employed, and the manufacturing importance of a nation can be measured
  by the consumption which is made of it. This acid would later be of great use to
  the settlers, in the manufacturing of candles, tanning skins, etc., but this time
  the engineer reserved it for another use.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding chose, behind the Chimneys, a site where the ground was perfectly
  level. On this ground he placed a layer of branches and chopped wood, on which were
  piled some pieces of shistose pyrites, buttressed one against the other, the whole
  being covered with a thin layer of pyrites, previously reduced to the size of a
  nut.</p>
- "<p>This done, they set fire to the wood, the heat was communicated to the shist,\
  \ which soon kindled, since it contains coal and sulphur. Then new layers of bruised\
  \ pyrites were arranged so as to form an immense heap, the exterior of which was\
  \ covered with earth and grass, several air\u2011holes being left, as if it was\
  \ a stack of wood which was to be carbonized to make charcoal.</p>"
- <p>They then left the transformation to complete itself, and it would not take less
  than ten or twelve days for the sulphuret of iron to be changed to sulphate of iron
  and the alumina into sulphate of alumina, two equally soluble substances, the others,
  flint, burnt coal, and cinders, not being so.</p>
- <p>While this chemical work was going on, Cyrus Harding proceeded with other operations,
  which were pursued with more than zeal,?it was eagerness.</p>
- "<p>Neb and Pencroft had taken away the fat from the dugong, and placed it in large\
  \ earthen pots. It was then necessary to separate the glycerine from the fat by\
  \ saponifying it. Now, to obtain this result, it had to be treated either with soda\
  \ or lime. In fact, one or other of these substances, after having attacked the\
  \ fat, would form a soap by separating the glycerine, and it was just this glycerine\
  \ which the engineer wished to obtain. There was no want of lime, only treatment\
  \ by lime would give calcareous soap, insoluble, and consequently useless, while\
  \ treatment by soda would furnish, on the contrary, a soluble soap, which could\
  \ be put to domestic use. Now, a practical man, like Cyrus Harding, would rather\
  \ try to obtain soda. Was this difficult? No; for marine plants abounded on the\
  \ shore, glass\u2011wort, ficoides, and all those fucaceae which form wrack. A large\
  \ quantity of these plants was collected, first dried, then burnt in holes in the\
  \ open air. The combustion of these plants was kept up for several days, and the\
  \ result was a compact gray mass, which has been long known under the name of \u201C\
  natural soda.\u201D</p>"
- <p>This obtained, the engineer treated the fat with soda, which gave both a soluble
  soap and that neutral substance, glycerine.</p>
- <p>But this was not all. Cyrus Harding still needed, in view of his future preparation,
  another substance, nitrate of potash, which is better known under the name of salt
  niter, or of saltpeter.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding could have manufactured this substance by treating the carbonate
  of potash, which would be easily extracted from the cinders of the vegetables, by
  azotic acid. But this acid was wanting, and he would have been in some difficulty,
  if nature had not happily furnished the saltpeter, without giving them any other
  trouble than that of picking it up. Herbert found a vein of it at the foot of Mount
  Franklin, and they had nothing to do but purify this salt.</p>
- <p>These different works lasted a week. They were finished before the transformation
  of the sulphuret into sulphate of iron had been accomplished. During the following
  days the settlers had time to construct a furnace of bricks of a particular arrangement,
  to serve for the distillation of the sulphate or iron when it had been obtained.
  All this was finished about the 18th of May, nearly at the time when the chemical
  transformation terminated. Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, skillfully
  directed by the engineer, had become most clever workmen. Before all masters, necessity
  is the one most listened to, and who teaches the best.</p>
- <p>When the heap of pyrites had been entirely reduced by fire, the result of the
  operation, consisting of sulphate of iron, sulphate of alumina, flint, remains of
  coal, and cinders was placed in a basinful of water. They stirred this mixture,
  let it settle, then decanted it, and obtained a clear liquid containing in solution
  sulphate of iron and sulphate of alumina, the other matters remaining solid, since
  they are insoluble. Lastly, this liquid being partly evaporated, crystals of sulphate
  of iron were deposited, and the not evaporated liquid, which contained the sulphate
  of alumina, was thrown away.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding had now at his disposal a large quantity of these sulphate of iron
  crystals, from which the sulphuric acid had to be extracted. The making of sulphuric
  acid is a very expensive manufacture. Considerable works are necessary?a special
  set of tools, an apparatus of platina, leaden chambers, unassailable by the acid,
  and in which the transformation is performed, etc. The engineer had none of these
  at his disposal, but he knew that, in Bohemia especially, sulphuric acid is manufactured
  by very simple means, which have also the advantage of producing it to a superior
  degree of concentration. It is thus that the acid known under the name of Nordhausen
  acid is made.</p>
- <p>To obtain sulphuric acid, Cyrus Harding had only one operation to make, to calcine
  the sulphate of iron crystals in a closed vase, so that the sulphuric acid should
  distil in vapor, which vapor, by condensation, would produce the acid.</p>
- <p>The crystals were placed in pots, and the heat from the furnace would distil
  the sulphuric acid. The operation was successfully completed, and on the 20th of
  May, twelve days after commencing it, the engineer was the possessor of the agent
  which later he hoped to use in so many different ways.</p>
- <p>Now, why did he wish for this agent? Simply to produce azotic acid; and that
  was easy, since saltpeter, attacked by sulphuric acid, gives azotic, or nitric,
  acid by distillation.</p>
- <p>But, after all, how was he going to employ this azotic acid? His companions were
  still ignorant of this, for he had not informed them of the result at which he aimed.</p>
- <p>However, the engineer had nearly accomplished his purpose, and by a last operation
  he would procure the substance which had given so much trouble.</p>
- "<p>Taking some azotic acid, he mixed it with glycerine, which had been previously\
  \ concentrated by evaporation, subjected to the water\u2011bath, and he obtained,\
  \ without even employing a refrigerant mixture, several pints of an oily yellow\
  \ mixture.</p>"
- <p>This last operation Cyrus Harding had made alone, in a retired place, at a distance
  from the Chimneys, for he feared the danger of an explosion, and when he showed
  a bottle of this liquid to his friends, he contented himself with saying,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CHere is nitro\u2011glycerine!\u201D</p>"
- <p>It was really this terrible production, of which the explosive power is perhaps
  tenfold that of ordinary powder, and which has already caused so many accidents.
  However, since a way has been found to transform it into dynamite, that is to say,
  to mix with it some solid substance, clay or sugar, porous enough to hold it, the
  dangerous liquid has been used with some security. But dynamite was not yet known
  at the time when the settlers worked on Lincoln Island.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAnd is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?\u201D said Pencroft\
  \ incredulously.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, my friend,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cand this nitro\u2011\
  glycerine will produce so much the more effect, as the granite is extremely hard,\
  \ and will oppose a greater resistance to the explosion.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd when shall we see this, captain?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo\u2011morrow, as soon as we have dug a hole for the mine, replied the\
  \ engineer.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The next day, the 21st of May, at daybreak, the miners went to the point which
  formed the eastern shore of Lake Grant, and was only five hundred feet from the
  coast. At this place, the plateau inclined downwards from the waters, which were
  only restrained by their granite case. Therefore, if this case was broken, the water
  would escape by the opening and form a stream, which, flowing over the inclined
  surface of the plateau, would rush on to the beach. Consequently, the level of the
  lake would be greatly lowered, and the opening where the water escaped would be
  exposed, which was their final aim.</p>
- "<p>Under the engineer\u2019s directions, Pencroft, armed with a pickaxe, which\
  \ he handled skillfully and vigorously, attacked the granite. The hole was made\
  \ on the point of the shore, slanting, so that it should meet a much lower level\
  \ than that of the water of the lake. In this way the explosive force, by scattering\
  \ the rock, would open a large place for the water to rush out.</p>"
- "<p>The work took some time, for the engineer, wishing to produce a great effect,\
  \ intended to devote not less than seven quarts of nitro\u2011glycerine to the operation.\
  \ But Pencroft, relieved by Neb, did so well, that towards four o\u2019clock in\
  \ the evening, the mine was finished.</p>"
- "<p>Now the question of setting fire to the explosive substance was raised. Generally,\
  \ nitro\u2011glycerine is ignited by caps of fulminate, which in bursting cause\
  \ the explosion. A shock is therefore needed to produce the explosion, for, simply\
  \ lighted, this substance would burn without exploding.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding could certainly have fabricated a percussion cap. In default of\
  \ fulminate, he could easily obtain a substance similar to guncotton, since he had\
  \ azotic acid at his disposal. This substance, pressed in a cartridge, and introduced\
  \ among the nitro\u2011glycerine, would burst by means of a fuse, and cause the\
  \ explosion.</p>"
- "<p>But Cyrus Harding knew that nitro\u2011glycerine would explode by a shock. He\
  \ resolved to employ this means, and try another way, if this did not succeed.</p>"
- "<p>In fact, the blow of a hammer on a few drops of nitro\u2011glycerine, spread\
  \ out on a hard surface, was enough to create an explosion. But the operator could\
  \ not be there to give the blow, without becoming a victim to the operation. Harding,\
  \ therefore, thought of suspending a mass of iron, weighing several pounds, by means\
  \ of a fiber, to an upright just above the mine. Another long fiber, previously\
  \ impregnated with sulphur, was attached to the middle of the first, by one end,\
  \ while the other lay on the ground several feet distant from the mine. The second\
  \ fiber being set on fire, it would burn till it reached the first. This catching\
  \ fire in its turn, would break, and the mass of iron would fall on the nitro\u2011\
  glycerine. This apparatus being then arranged, the engineer, after having sent his\
  \ companions to a distance, filled the hole, so that the nitro\u2011glycerine was\
  \ on a level with the opening; then he threw a few drops of it on the surface of\
  \ the rock, above which the mass of iron was already suspended.</p>"
- <p>This done, Harding lit the end of the sulphured fiber, and leaving the place,
  he returned with his companions to the Chimneys.</p>
- <p>The fiber was intended to burn five and twenty minutes, and, in fact, five and
  twenty minutes afterwards a most tremendous explosion was heard. The island appeared
  to tremble to its very foundation. Stones were projected in the air as if by the
  eruption of a volcano. The shock produced by the displacing of the air was such,
  that the rocks of the Chimneys shook. The settlers, although they were more than
  two miles from the mine, were thrown on the ground.</p>
- <p>They rose, climbed the plateau, and ran towards the place where the bank of the
  lake must have been shattered by the explosion.</p>
- <p>A cheer escaped them! A large rent was seen in the granite! A rapid stream of
  water rushed foaming across the plateau and dashed down a height of three hundred
  feet on to the beach!</p>
- <p>Chapter 18</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding\u2019s project had succeeded, but, according to his usual habit\
  \ he showed no satisfaction; with closed lips and a fixed look, he remained motionless.\
  \ Herbert was in ecstasies, Neb bounded with joy, Pencroft nodded his great head,\
  \ murmuring these words,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCome, our engineer gets on capitally!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The nitro\u2011glycerine had indeed acted powerfully. The opening which it had\
  \ made was so large that the volume of water which escaped through this new outlet\
  \ was at least treble that which before passed through the old one. The result was,\
  \ that a short time after the operation the level of the lake would be lowered two\
  \ feet, or more.</p>"
- "<p>The settlers went to the Chimneys to take some pickaxes, iron\u2011tipped spears,\
  \ string made of fibers, flint and steel; they then returned to the plateau, Top\
  \ accompanying them.</p>"
- <p>On the way the sailor could not help saying to the engineer,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CDon\u2019t you think, captain, that by means of that charming liquid you\
  \ have made, one could blow up the whole of our island?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWithout any doubt, the island, continents, and the world itself,\u201D\
  \ replied the engineer. \u201CIt is only a question of quantity.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen could you not use this nitro\u2011glycerine for loading firearms?\u201D\
  \ asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Pencroft; for it is too explosive a substance. But it would be easy\
  \ to make some guncotton, or even ordinary powder, as we have azotic acid, saltpeter,\
  \ sulphur, and coal. Unhappily, it is the guns which we have not got.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh, captain,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cwith a little determination?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>Pencroft had erased the word \u201Cimpossible\u201D from the dictionary of Lincoln\
  \ Island.</p>"
- <p>The settlers, having arrived at Prospect Heights, went immediately towards that
  point of the lake near which was the old opening now uncovered. This outlet had
  now become practicable, since the water no longer rushed through it, and it would
  doubtless be easy to explore the interior.</p>
- <p>In a few minutes the settlers had reached the lower point of the lake, and a
  glance showed them that the object had been attained.</p>
- "<p>In fact, in the side of the lake, and now above the surface of the water, appeared\
  \ the long\u2011looked\u2011for opening. A narrow ridge, left bare by the retreat\
  \ of the water, allowed them to approach it. This orifice was nearly twenty feet\
  \ in width, but scarcely two in height. It was like the mouth of a drain at the\
  \ edge of the pavement, and therefore did not offer an easy passage to the settlers;\
  \ but Neb and Pencroft, taking their pickaxes, soon made it of a suitable height.</p>"
- "<p>The engineer then approached, and found that the sides of the opening, in its\
  \ upper part at least, had not a slope of more than from thirty to thirty\u2011\
  five degrees. It was therefore practicable, and, provided that the declivity did\
  \ not increase, it would be easy to descend even to the level of the sea. If then,\
  \ as was probable, some vast cavity existed in the interior of the granite, it might,\
  \ perhaps, be of great use.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, captain, what are we stopping for?\u201D asked the sailor, impatient\
  \ to enter the narrow passage. \u201CYou see Top has got before us!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery well,\u201D replied the engineer. \u201CBut we must see our way.\
  \ Neb, go and cut some resinous branches.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Neb and Herbert ran to the edge of the lake, shaded with pines and other green
  trees, and soon returned with some branches, which they made into torches. The torches
  were lighted with flint and steel, and Cyrus Harding leading, the settlers ventured
  into the dark passage, which the overplus of the lake had formerly filled.</p>
- <p>Contrary to what might have been supposed, the diameter of the passage increased
  as the explorers proceeded, so that they very soon were able to stand upright. The
  granite, worn by the water for an infinite time, was very slippery, and falls were
  to be dreaded. But the settlers were all attached to each other by a cord, as is
  frequently done in ascending mountains. Happily some projections of the granite,
  forming regular steps, made the descent less perilous. Drops, still hanging from
  the rocks, shone here and there under the light of the torches, and the explorers
  guessed that the sides were clothed with innumerable stalactites. The engineer examined
  this black granite. There was not a stratum, not a break in it. The mass was compact,
  and of an extremely close grain. The passage dated, then, from the very origin of
  the island. It was not the water which little by little had hollowed it. Pluto and
  not Neptune had bored it with his own hand, and on the wall traces of an eruptive
  work could be distinguished, which all the washing of the water had not been able
  totally to efface.</p>
- <p>The settlers descended very slowly. They could not but feel a certain awe, in
  this venturing into these unknown depths, for the first time visited by human beings.
  They did not speak, but they thought; and the thought came to more than one, that
  some polypus or other gigantic cephalopod might inhabit the interior cavities, which
  were in communication with the sea. However, Top kept at the head of the little
  band, and they could rely on the sagacity of the dog, who would not fail to give
  the alarm if there was any need for it.</p>
- <p>After having descended about a hundred feet, following a winding road, Harding
  who was walking on before, stopped, and his companions came up with him. The place
  where they had halted was wider, so as to form a cavern of moderate dimensions.
  Drops of water fell from the vault, but that did not prove that they oozed through
  the rock. They were simply the last traces left by the torrent which had so long
  thundered through this cavity, and the air there was pure though slightly damp,
  but producing no mephitic exhalation.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, my dear Cyrus,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Chere is a very secure\
  \ retreat, well hid in the depths of the rock, but it is, however, uninhabitable.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy uninhabitable?\u201D asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBecause it is too small and too dark.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCouldn\u2019t we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light\
  \ and air?\u201D replied Pencroft, who now thought nothing impossible.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us go on with our exploration,\u201D said Cyrus Harding. \u201CPerhaps\
  \ lower down, nature will have spared us this labor.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe have only gone a third of the way,\u201D observed Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNearly a third,\u201D replied Harding, \u201Cfor we have descended a hundred\
  \ feet from the opening, and it is not impossible that a hundred feet farther down?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhere is Top?\u201D asked Neb, interrupting his master.</p>"
- <p>They searched the cavern, but the dog was not there.</p>
- "<p>\u201CMost likely he has gone on,\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us join him,\u201D replied Harding.</p>"
- <p>The descent was continued. The engineer carefully observed all the deviations
  of the passage, and notwithstanding so many detours, he could easily have given
  an account of its general direction, which went towards the sea.</p>
- <p>The settlers had gone some fifty feet farther, when their attention was attracted
  by distant sounds which came up from the depths. They stopped and listened. These
  sounds, carried through the passage as through an acoustic tube, came clearly to
  the ear.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThat is Top barking!\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cand our brave dog is barking furiously!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe have our iron\u2011tipped spears,\u201D said Cyrus Harding. \u201C\
  Keep on your guard, and forward!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is becoming more and more interesting,\u201D murmured Gideon Spilett\
  \ in the sailor\u2019s ear, who nodded. Harding and his companions rushed to the\
  \ help of their dog. Top\u2019s barking became more and more perceptible, and it\
  \ seemed strangely fierce. Was he engaged in a struggle with some animal whose retreat\
  \ he had disturbed? Without thinking of the danger to which they might be exposed,\
  \ the explorers were now impelled by an irresistible curiosity, and in a few minutes,\
  \ sixteen feet lower they rejoined Top.</p>"
- <p>There the passage ended in a vast and magnificent cavern.</p>
- <p>Top was running backwards and forwards, barking furiously. Pencroft and Neb,
  waving their torches, threw the light into every crevice; and at the same time,
  Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, their spears raised, were ready for any emergency
  which might arise. The enormous cavern was empty. The settlers explored it in every
  direction. There was nothing there, not an animal, not a human being; and yet Top
  continued to bark. Neither caresses nor threats could make him be silent.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThere must be a place somewhere, by which the waters of the lake reached\
  \ the sea,\u201D said the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COf course,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cand we must take care not to\
  \ tumble into a hole.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGo, Top, go!\u201D cried Harding.</p>"
- "<p>The dog, excited by his master\u2019s words, ran towards the extremity of the\
  \ cavern, and there redoubled his barking.</p>"
- <p>They followed him, and by the light of the torches, perceived the mouth of a
  regular well in the granite. It was by this that the water escaped; and this time
  it was not an oblique and practicable passage, but a perpendicular well, into which
  it was impossible to venture.</p>
- '<p>The torches were held over the opening: nothing could be seen. Harding took
  a lighted branch, and threw it into the abyss. The blazing resin, whose illuminating
  power increased still more by the rapidity of its fall, lighted up the interior
  of the well, but yet nothing appeared. The flame then went out with a slight hiss,
  which showed that it had reached the water, that is to say, the level of the sea.</p>'
- <p>The engineer, calculating the time employed in its fall, was able to calculate
  the depth of the well, which was found to be about ninety feet.</p>
- <p>The floor of the cavern must thus be situated ninety feet above the level of
  the sea.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHere is our dwelling,\u201D said Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut it was occupied by some creature,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, whose\
  \ curiosity was not yet satisfied.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, the creature, amphibious or otherwise, has made off through this\
  \ opening,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cand has left the place for us.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNever mind,\u201D added the sailor, \u201CI should like very much to be\
  \ Top just for a quarter of an hour, for he doesn\u2019t bark for nothing!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding looked at his dog, and those of his companions who were near him
  might have heard him murmur these words,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CYes, I believe that Top knows more than we do about a great many things.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>However, the wishes of the settlers were for the most part satisfied. Chance,
  aided by the marvelous sagacity of their leader, had done them great service. They
  had now at their disposal a vast cavern, the size of which could not be properly
  calculated by the feeble light of their torches, but it would certainly be easy
  to divide it into rooms, by means of brick partitions, or to use it, if not as a
  house, at least as a spacious apartment. The water which had left it could not return.
  The place was free.</p>
- <p>Two difficulties remained; firstly, the possibility of lighting this excavation
  in the midst of solid rock; secondly, the necessity of rendering the means of access
  more easy. It was useless to think of lighting it from above, because of the enormous
  thickness of the granite which composed the ceiling; but perhaps the outer wall
  next the sea might be pierced. Cyrus Harding, during the descent, had roughly calculated
  its obliqueness, and consequently the length of the passage, and was therefore led
  to believe that the outer wall could not be very thick. If light was thus obtained,
  so would a means of access, for it would be as easy to pierce a door as windows,
  and to establish an exterior ladder.</p>
- <p>Harding made known his ideas to his companions.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThen, captain, let us set to work!\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201CI have\
  \ my pickaxe, and I shall soon make my way through this wall. Where shall I strike?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CHere,\u201D replied the engineer, showing the sturdy sailor a considerable\
  \ recess in the side, which would much diminish the thickness.</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft attacked the granite, and for half an hour, by the light of the torches,\
  \ he made the splinters fly around him. Neb relieved him, then Spilett took Neb\u2019\
  s place.</p>"
- <p>This work had lasted two hours, and they began to fear that at this spot the
  wall would not yield to the pickaxe, when at a last blow given by Gideon Spilett,
  the instrument, passing through the rock, fell outside.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHurrah! hurrah!\u201D cried Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>The wall only measured there three feet in thickness.</p>
- "<p>Harding applied his eye to the aperture, which overlooked the ground from a\
  \ height of eighty feet. Before him was extended the sea\u2011coast, the islet,\
  \ and beyond the open sea.</p>"
- <p>Floods of light entered by this hole, inundating the splendid cavern and producing
  a magic effect! On its left side it did not measure more than thirty feet in height
  and breadth, but on the right it was enormous, and its vaulted roof rose to a height
  of more than eighty feet.</p>
- <p>In some places granite pillars, irregularly disposed, supported the vaulted roof,
  as those in the nave of a cathedral, here forming lateral piers, there elliptical
  arches, adorned with pointed moldings, losing themselves in dark bays, amid the
  fantastic arches of which glimpses could be caught in the shade, covered with a
  profusion of projections formed like so many pendants. This cavern was a picturesque
  mixture of all the styles of Byzantine, Roman, or Gothic architecture ever produced
  by the hand of man. And yet this was only the work of nature. She alone had hollowed
  this fairy Alhambra in a mass of granite.</p>
- <p>The settlers were overwhelmed with admiration. Where they had only expected to
  find a narrow cavity, they had found a sort of marvelous palace, and Neb had taken
  off his hat, as if he had been transported into a temple!</p>
- <p>Cries of admiration issued from every mouth. Hurrahs resounded, and the echo
  was repeated again and again till it died away in the dark naves.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAh, my friends!\u201D exclaimed Cyrus Harding, \u201Cwhen we have lighted\
  \ the interior of this place, and have arranged our rooms and storehouses in the\
  \ left part, we shall still have this splendid cavern, which we will make our study\
  \ and our museum!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd we will call it??\u201D asked Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGranite House,\u201D replied Harding; a name which his companions again\
  \ saluted with a cheer.</p>"
- <p>The torches were now almost consumed, and as they were obliged to return by the
  passage to reach the summit of the plateau, it was decided to put off the work necessary
  for the arrangement of their new dwelling till the next day.</p>
- <p>Before departing, Cyrus Harding leaned once more over the dark well, which descended
  perpendicularly to the level of the sea. He listened attentively. No noise was heard,
  not even that of the water, which the undulations of the surge must sometimes agitate
  in its depths. A flaming branch was again thrown in. The sides of the well were
  lighted up for an instant, but as at the first time, nothing suspicious was seen.</p>
- <p>If some marine monster had been surprised unawares by the retreat of the water,
  he would by this time have regained the sea by the subterranean passage, before
  the new opening had been offered to him.</p>
- <p>Meanwhile, the engineer was standing motionless, his eyes fixed on the gulf,
  without uttering a word.</p>
- "<p>The sailor approached him, and touching his arm, \u201CCaptain!\u201D said he.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat do you want, my friend?\u201D asked the engineer, as if he had returned\
  \ from the land of dreams.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe torches will soon go out.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CForward!\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>The little band left the cavern and began to ascend through the dark passage.\
  \ Top closed the rear, still growling every now and then. The ascent was painful\
  \ enough. The settlers rested a few minutes in the upper grotto, which made a sort\
  \ of landing\u2011place halfway up the long granite staircase. Then they began to\
  \ climb again.</p>"
- <p>Soon fresher air was felt. The drops of water, dried by evaporation, no longer
  sparkled on the walls. The flaring torches began to grow dim. The one which Neb
  carried went out, and if they did not wish to find their way in the dark, they must
  hasten.</p>
- "<p>This was done, and a little before four o\u2019clock, at the moment when the\
  \ sailor\u2019s torch went out in its turn, Cyrus Harding and his companions passed\
  \ out of the passage.</p>"
- <p>Chapter 19</p>
- "<p>The next day, the 22nd of May, the arrangement of their new dwelling was commenced.\
  \ In fact, the settlers longed to exchange the insufficient shelter of the Chimneys\
  \ for this large and healthy retreat, in the midst of solid rock, and sheltered\
  \ from the water both of the sea and sky. Their former dwelling was not, however,\
  \ to be entirely abandoned, for the engineer intended to make a manufactory of it\
  \ for important works. Cyrus Harding\u2019s first care was to find out the position\
  \ of the front of Granite House from the outside. He went to the beach, and as the\
  \ pickaxe when it escaped from the hands of the reporter must have fallen perpendicularly\
  \ to the foot of the cliff, the finding it would be sufficient to show the place\
  \ where the hole had been pierced in the granite.</p>"
- "<p>The pickaxe was easily found, and the hole could be seen in a perpendicular\
  \ line above the spot where it was stuck in the sand. Some rock pigeons were already\
  \ flying in and out of the narrow opening; they evidently thought that Granite House\
  \ had been discovered on purpose for them. It was the engineer\u2019s intention\
  \ to divide the right portion of the cavern into several rooms, preceded by an entrance\
  \ passage, and to light it by means of five windows and a door, pierced in the front.\
  \ Pencroft was much pleased with the five windows, but he could not understand the\
  \ use of the door, since the passage offered a natural staircase, through which\
  \ it would always be easy to enter Granite House.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy friend,\u201D replied Harding, \u201Cif it is easy for us to reach\
  \ our dwelling by this passage, it will be equally easy for others besides us. I\
  \ mean, on the contrary, to block up that opening, to seal it hermetically, and,\
  \ if it is necessary, to completely hide the entrance by making a dam, and thus\
  \ causing the water of the lake to rise.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd how shall we get in?\u201D asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBy an outside ladder,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Ca rope ladder,\
  \ which, once drawn up, will render access to our dwelling impossible.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut why so many precautions?\u201D asked Pencroft. \u201CAs yet we have\
  \ seen no dangerous animals. As to our island being inhabited by natives, I don\u2019\
  t believe it!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAre you quite sure of that, Pencroft?\u201D asked the engineer, looking\
  \ at the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COf course we shall not be quite sure, till we have explored it in every\
  \ direction,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D said Harding, \u201Cfor we know only a small portion of it\
  \ as yet. But at any rate, if we have no enemies in the interior, they may come\
  \ from the exterior, for parts of the Pacific are very dangerous. We must be provided\
  \ against every contingency.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding spoke wisely; and without making any further objection, Pencroft
  prepared to execute his orders.</p>
- "<p>The front of Granite House was then to be lighted by five windows and a door,\
  \ besides a large bay window and some smaller oval ones, which would admit plenty\
  \ of light to enter into the marvelous nave which was to be their chief room. This\
  \ facade, situated at a height of eighty feet above the ground, was exposed to the\
  \ east, and the rising sun saluted it with its first rays. It was found to be just\
  \ at that part of the cliff which was between the projection at the mouth of the\
  \ Mercy and a perpendicular line traced above the heap of rocks which formed the\
  \ Chimneys. Thus the winds from the northeast would only strike it obliquely, for\
  \ it was protected by the projection. Besides, until the window\u2011frames were\
  \ made, the engineer meant to close the openings with thick shutters, which would\
  \ prevent either wind or rain from entering, and which could be concealed in need.</p>"
- "<p>The first work was to make the openings. This would have taken too long with\
  \ the pickaxe alone, and it is known that Harding was an ingenious man. He had still\
  \ a quantity of nitro\u2011glycerine at his disposal, and he employed it usefully.\
  \ By means of this explosive substance the rock was broken open at the very places\
  \ chosen by the engineer. Then, with the pickaxe and spade, the windows and doors\
  \ were properly shaped, the jagged edges were smoothed off, and a few days after\
  \ the beginning of the work, Granite House was abundantly lighted by the rising\
  \ sun, whose rays penetrated into its most secret recesses. Following the plan proposed\
  \ by Cyrus Harding, the space was to be divided into five compartments looking out\
  \ on the sea; to the right, an entry with a door, which would meet the ladder; then\
  \ a kitchen, thirty feet long; a dining\u2011room, measuring forty feet; a sleeping\u2011\
  room, of equal size; and lastly, a \u201CVisitor\u2019s room,\u201D petitioned for\
  \ by Pencroft, and which was next to the great hall. These rooms, or rather this\
  \ suite of rooms, would not occupy all the depth of the cave. There would be also\
  \ a corridor and a storehouse, in which their tools, provisions, and stores would\
  \ be kept. All the productions of the island, the flora as well as the fauna, were\
  \ to be there in the best possible state of preservation, and completely sheltered\
  \ from the damp. There was no want of space, so that each object could be methodically\
  \ arranged. Besides, the colonists had still at their disposal the little grotto\
  \ above the great cavern, which was like the garret of the new dwelling.</p>"
- "<p>This plan settled, it had only to be put into execution. The miners became brickmakers\
  \ again, then the bricks were brought to the foot of Granite House. Till then, Harding\
  \ and his companions had only entered the cavern by the long passage. This mode\
  \ of communication obliged them first to climb Prospect Heights, making a detour\
  \ by the river\u2019s bank, and then to descend two hundred feet through the passage,\
  \ having to climb as far when they wished to return to the plateau. This was a great\
  \ loss of time, and was also very fatiguing. Cyrus Harding, therefore, resolved\
  \ to proceed without any further delay to the fabrication of a strong rope ladder,\
  \ which, once raised, would render Granite House completely inaccessible.</p>"
- <p>This ladder was manufactured with extreme care, and its uprights, formed of the
  twisted fibers of a species of cane, had the strength of a thick cable. As to the
  rounds, they were made of a sort of red cedar, with light, strong branches; and
  this apparatus was wrought by the masterly hand of Pencroft.</p>
- <p>Other ropes were made with vegetable fibers, and a sort of crane with a tackle
  was fixed at the door. In this way bricks could easily be raised into Granite House.
  The transport of the materials being thus simplified, the arrangement of the interior
  could begin immediately. There was no want of lime, and some thousands of bricks
  were there ready to be used. The framework of the partitions was soon raised, very
  roughly at first, and in a short time, the cave was divided into rooms and storehouses,
  according to the plan agreed upon.</p>
- "<p>These different works progressed rapidly under the direction of the engineer,\
  \ who himself handled the hammer and the trowel. No labor came amiss to Cyrus Harding,\
  \ who thus set an example to his intelligent and zealous companions. They worked\
  \ with confidence, even gaily, Pencroft always having some joke to crack, sometimes\
  \ carpenter, sometimes rope\u2011maker, sometimes mason, while he communicated his\
  \ good humor to all the members of their little world. His faith in the engineer\
  \ was complete; nothing could disturb it. He believed him capable of undertaking\
  \ anything and succeeding in everything. The question of boots and clothes?assuredly\
  \ a serious question,?that of light during the winter months, utilizing the fertile\
  \ parts of the island, transforming the wild flora into cultivated flora, it all\
  \ appeared easy to him; Cyrus Harding helping, everything would be done in time.\
  \ He dreamed of canals facilitating the transport of the riches of the ground; workings\
  \ of quarries and mines; machines for every industrial manufacture; railroads; yes,\
  \ railroads! of which a network would certainly one day cover Lincoln Island.</p>"
- <p>The engineer let Pencroft talk. He did not put down the aspirations of this brave
  heart. He knew how communicable confidence is; he even smiled to hear him speak,
  and said nothing of the uneasiness for the future which he felt. In fact, in that
  part of the Pacific, out of the course of vessels, it was to be feared that no help
  would ever come to them. It was on themselves, on themselves alone, that the settlers
  must depend, for the distance of Lincoln Island from all other land was such, that
  to hazard themselves in a boat, of a necessarily inferior construction, would be
  a serious and perilous thing.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D as the sailor said, \u201Cthey quite took the wind out of the\
  \ sails of the Robinsons, for whom everything was done by a miracle.\u201D</p>"
- <p>In fact, they were energetic; an energetic man will succeed where an indolent
  one would vegetate and inevitably perish.</p>
- "<p>Herbert distinguished himself in these works. He was intelligent and active;\
  \ understanding quickly, he performed well; and Cyrus Harding became more and more\
  \ attached to the boy. Herbert had a lively and reverent love for the engineer.\
  \ Pencroft saw the close sympathy which existed between the two, but he was not\
  \ in the least jealous. Neb was Neb: he was what he would be always, courage, zeal,\
  \ devotion, self\u2011denial personified. He had the same faith in his master that\
  \ Pencroft had, but he showed it less vehemently. When the sailor was enthusiastic,\
  \ Neb always looked as if he would say, \u201CNothing could be more natural.\u201D\
  \ Pencroft and he were great friends.</p>"
- "<p>As to Gideon Spilett, he took part in the common work, and was not less skilful\
  \ in it than his companions, which always rather astonished the sailor. A \u201C\
  journalist,\u201D clever, not only in understanding, but in performing everything.</p>"
- "<p>The ladder was finally fixed on the 28th of May. There were not less than a\
  \ hundred rounds in this perpendicular height of eighty feet. Harding had been able,\
  \ fortunately, to divide it in two parts, profiting by an overhanging of the cliff\
  \ which made a projection forty feet above the ground. This projection, carefully\
  \ leveled by the pickaxe, made a sort of platform, to which they fixed the first\
  \ ladder, of which the oscillation was thus diminished one\u2011half, and a rope\
  \ permitted it to be raised to the level of Granite House. As to the second ladder,\
  \ it was secured both at its lower part, which rested on the projection, and at\
  \ its upper end, which was fastened to the door. In short the ascent had been made\
  \ much easier. Besides, Cyrus Harding hoped later to establish an hydraulic apparatus,\
  \ which would avoid all fatigue and loss of time, for the inhabitants of Granite\
  \ House.</p>"
- <p>The settlers soon became habituated to the use of this ladder. They were light
  and active, and Pencroft, as a sailor, accustomed to run up the masts and shrouds,
  was able to give them lessons. But it was also necessary to give them to Top. The
  poor dog, with his four paws, was not formed for this sort of exercise. But Pencroft
  was such a zealous master, that Top ended by properly performing his ascents, and
  soon mounted the ladder as readily as his brethren in the circus. It need not be
  said that the sailor was proud of his pupil. However, more than once Pencroft hoisted
  him on his back, which Top never complained of.</p>
- "<p>It must be mentioned here, that during these works, which were actively conducted,\
  \ for the bad season was approaching, the alimentary question was not neglected.\
  \ Every day, the reporter and Herbert, who had been voted purveyors to the colony,\
  \ devoted some hours to the chase. As yet, they only hunted in Jacamar Wood, on\
  \ the left of the river, because, for want of a bridge or boat, the Mercy had not\
  \ yet been crossed. All the immense woods, to which the name of the Forests of the\
  \ Far West had been given, were not explored. They reserved this important excursion\
  \ for the first fine days of the next spring. But Jacamar Wood was full of game;\
  \ kangaroos and boars abounded, and the hunters\u2019 iron\u2011tipped spears and\
  \ bows and arrows did wonders. Besides, Herbert discovered towards the southwest\
  \ point of the lagoon a natural warren, a slightly damp meadow, covered with willows\
  \ and aromatic herbs which scented the air, such as thyme, basil, savory, all the\
  \ sweet\u2011scented species of the labiated plants, which the rabbits appeared\
  \ to be particularly fond of.</p>"
- "<p>On the reporter observing that since the table was spread for the rabbits, it\
  \ was strange that the rabbits themselves should be wanting, the two sportsmen carefully\
  \ explored the warren. At any rate, it produced an abundance of useful plants, and\
  \ a naturalist would have had a good opportunity of studying many specimens of the\
  \ vegetable kingdom. Herbert gathered several shoots of the basil, rosemary, balm,\
  \ betony, etc., which possess different medicinal properties, some pectoral, astringent,\
  \ febrifuge, others anti\u2011spasmodic, or anti\u2011rheumatic. When, afterwards,\
  \ Pencroft asked the use of this collection of herbs,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFor medicine,\u201D replied the lad, \u201Cto treat us when we are ill.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy should we be ill, since there are no doctors in the island?\u201D\
  \ asked Pencroft quite seriously.</p>"
- "<p>There was no reply to be made to that, but the lad went on with his collection\
  \ all the same, and it was well received at Granite House. Besides these medicinal\
  \ herbs, he added a plant known in North America as \u201COswego tea,\u201D which\
  \ made an excellent beverage.</p>"
- <p>At last, by searching thoroughly, the hunters arrived at the real site of the
  warren. There the ground was perforated like a sieve.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHere are the burrows!\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Cso I see.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut are they inhabited?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is the question.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>This was soon answered. Almost immediately, hundreds of little animals, similar\
  \ to rabbits, fled in every direction, with such rapidity that even Top could not\
  \ overtake them. Hunters and dog ran in vain; these rodents escaped them easily.\
  \ But the reporter resolved not to leave the place, until he had captured at least\
  \ half\u2011a\u2011dozen of the quadrupeds. He wished to stock their larder first,\
  \ and domesticate those which they might take later. It would not have been difficult\
  \ to do this, with a few snares stretched at the openings of the burrows. But at\
  \ this moment they had neither snares, nor anything to make them of. They must,\
  \ therefore, be satisfied with visiting each hole, and rummaging in it with a stick,\
  \ hoping by dint of patience to do what could not be done in any other way.</p>"
- <p>At last, after half an hour, four rodents were taken in their holes. They were
  similar to their European brethren, and are commonly known by the name of American
  rabbits.</p>
- <p>This produce of the chase was brought back to Granite House, and figured at the
  evening repast. The tenants of the warren were not at all to be despised, for they
  were delicious. It was a valuable resource of the colony, and it appeared to be
  inexhaustible.</p>
- <p>On the 31st of May the partitions were finished. The rooms had now only to be
  furnished, and this would be work for the long winter days. A chimney was established
  in the first room, which served as a kitchen. The pipe destined to conduct the smoke
  outside gave some trouble to these amateur bricklayers. It appeared simplest to
  Harding to make it of brick clay; as creating an outlet for it to the upper plateau
  was not to be thought of, a hole was pierced in the granite above the window of
  the kitchen, and the pipe met it like that of an iron stove. Perhaps the winds which
  blew directly against the facade would make the chimney smoke, but these winds were
  rare, and besides, Master Neb, the cook, was not so very particular about that.</p>
- "<p>When these interior arrangements were finished, the engineer occupied himself\
  \ in blocking up the outlet by the lake, so as to prevent any access by that way.\
  \ Masses of rock were rolled to the entrance and strongly cemented together. Cyrus\
  \ Harding did not yet realize his plan of drowning this opening under the waters\
  \ of the lake, by restoring them to their former level by means of a dam. He contented\
  \ himself with hiding the obstruction with grass and shrubs, which were planted\
  \ in the interstices of the rocks, and which next spring would sprout thickly. However,\
  \ he used the waterfall so as to lead a small stream of fresh water to the new dwelling.\
  \ A little trench, made below their level, produced this result; and this derivation\
  \ from a pure and inexhaustible source yielded twenty\u2011five or thirty gallons\
  \ a day. There would never be any want of water at Granite House. At last all was\
  \ finished, and it was time, for the bad season was near. Thick shutters closed\
  \ the windows of the facade, until the engineer had time to make glass.</p>"
- <p>Gideon Spilett had very artistically arranged on the rocky projections around
  the windows plants of different kinds, as well as long streaming grass, so that
  the openings were picturesquely framed in green, which had a pleasing effect.</p>
- "<p>The inhabitants of this solid, healthy, and secure dwelling, could not but be\
  \ charmed with their work. The view from the windows extended over a boundless horizon,\
  \ which was closed by the two Mandible Capes on the north, and Claw Cape on the\
  \ south. All Union Bay was spread before them. Yes, our brave settlers had reason\
  \ to be satisfied, and Pencroft was lavish in his praise of what he humorously called,\
  \ \u201Chis apartments on the fifth floor above the ground!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 20</p>
- <p>The winter season set in with the month of June, which corresponds with the month
  of December in the Northern Hemisphere. It began with showers and squalls, which
  succeeded each other without intermission. The tenants of Granite House could appreciate
  the advantages of a dwelling which sheltered them from the inclement weather. The
  Chimneys would have been quite insufficient to protect them against the rigor of
  winter, and it was to be feared that the high tides would make another irruption.
  Cyrus Harding had taken precautions against this contingency, so as to preserve
  as much as possible the forge and furnace which were established there.</p>
- <p>During the whole of the month of June the time was employed in different occupations,
  which excluded neither hunting nor fishing, the larder being, therefore, abundantly
  supplied. Pencroft, so soon as he had leisure, proposed to set some traps, from
  which he expected great results. He soon made some snares with creepers, by the
  aid of which the warren henceforth every day furnished its quota of rodents. Neb
  employed nearly all his time in salting or smoking meat, which insured their always
  having plenty of provisions. The question of clothes was now seriously discussed,
  the settlers having no other garments than those they wore when the balloon threw
  them on the island. These clothes were warm and good; they had taken great care
  of them as well as of their linen, and they were perfectly whole, but they would
  soon need to be replaced. Moreover, if the winter was severe, the settlers would
  suffer greatly from cold.</p>
- <p>On this subject the ingenuity of Harding was at fault. They must provide for
  their most pressing wants, settle their dwelling, and lay in a store of food; thus
  the cold might come upon them before the question of clothes had been settled. They
  must therefore make up their minds to pass this first winter without additional
  clothing. When the fine season came round again, they would regularly hunt those
  musmons which had been seen on the expedition to Mount Franklin, and the wool once
  collected, the engineer would know how to make it into strong warm stuff.... How?
  He would consider.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, we are free to roast ourselves at Granite House!\u201D said Pencroft.\
  \ \u201CThere are heaps of fuel, and no reason for sparing it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBesides,\u201D added Gideon Spilett, \u201CLincoln Island is not situated\
  \ under a very high latitude, and probably the winters here are not severe. Did\
  \ you not say, Cyrus, that this thirty\u2011fifth parallel corresponded to that\
  \ of Spain in the other hemisphere?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDoubtless,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cbut some winters in Spain\
  \ are very cold! No want of snow and ice; and perhaps Lincoln Island is just as\
  \ rigorously tried. However, it is an island, and as such, I hope that the temperature\
  \ will be more moderate.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy, captain?\u201D asked Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBecause the sea, my boy, may be considered as an immense reservoir, in\
  \ which is stored the heat of the summer. When winter comes, it restores this heat,\
  \ which insures for the regions near the ocean a medium temperature, less high in\
  \ summer, but less low in winter.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall prove that,\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201CBut I don\u2019t want\
  \ to bother myself about whether it will be cold or not. One thing is certain, that\
  \ is that the days are already short, and the evenings long. Suppose we talk about\
  \ the question of light.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNothing is easier,\u201D replied Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo talk about?\u201D asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo settle.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd when shall we begin?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo\u2011morrow, by having a seal hunt.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo make candles?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Such was the engineer\u2019s project; and it was quite feasible, since he had\
  \ lime and sulphuric acid, while the amphibians of the islet would furnish the fat\
  \ necessary for the manufacture.</p>"
- <p>They were now at the 4th of June. It was Whit Sunday and they agreed to observe
  this feast. All work was suspended, and prayers were offered to Heaven. But these
  prayers were now thanksgivings. The settlers in Lincoln Island were no longer the
  miserable castaways thrown on the islet. They asked for nothing more?they gave thanks.
  The next day, the 5th of June, in rather uncertain weather, they set out for the
  islet. They had to profit by the low tide to cross the Channel, and it was agreed
  that they would construct, for this purpose, as well as they could, a boat which
  would render communication so much easier, and would also permit them to ascend
  the Mercy, at the time of their grand exploration of the southwest of the island,
  which was put off till the first fine days.</p>
- "<p>The seals were numerous, and the hunters, armed with their iron\u2011tipped\
  \ spears, easily killed half\u2011a\u2011dozen. Neb and Pencroft skinned them, and\
  \ only brought back to Granite House their fat and skin, this skin being intended\
  \ for the manufacture of boots.</p>"
- '<p>The result of the hunt was this: nearly three hundred pounds of fat, all to
  be employed in the fabrication of candles.</p>'
- <p>The operation was extremely simple, and if it did not yield absolutely perfect
  results, they were at least very useful. Cyrus Harding would only have had at his
  disposal sulphuric acid, but by heating this acid with the neutral fatty bodies
  he could separate the glycerine; then from this new combination, he easily separated
  the olein, the margarin, and the stearin, by employing boiling water. But to simplify
  the operation, he preferred to saponify the fat by means of lime. By this he obtained
  a calcareous soap, easy to decompose by sulphuric acid, which precipitated the lime
  into the state of sulphate, and liberated the fatty acids.</p>
- "<p>From these three acids\u2011oleic, margaric, and stearic\u2011the first, being\
  \ liquid, was driven out by a sufficient pressure. As to the two others, they formed\
  \ the very substance of which the candles were to be molded.</p>"
- <p>This operation did not last more than four and twenty hours. The wicks, after
  several trials, were made of vegetable fibers, and dipped in the liquefied substance,
  they formed regular stearic candles, molded by the hand, which only wanted whiteness
  and polish. They would not doubtless have the advantages of the wicks which are
  impregnated with boracic acid, and which vitrify as they burn and are entirely consumed,
  but Cyrus Harding having manufactured a beautiful pair of snuffers, these candles
  would be greatly appreciated during the long evenings in Granite House.</p>
- <p>During this month there was no want of work in the interior of their new dwelling.
  The joiners had plenty to do. They improved their tools, which were very rough,
  and added others also.</p>
- <p>Scissors were made among other things, and the settlers were at last able to
  cut their hair, and also to shave, or at least trim their beards. Herbert had none,
  Neb but little, but their companions were bristling in a way which justified the
  making of the said scissors.</p>
- "<p>The manufacture of a hand\u2011saw cost infinite trouble, but at last an instrument\
  \ was obtained which, when vigorously handled, could divide the ligneous fibers\
  \ of the wood. They then made tables, seats, cupboards, to furnish the principal\
  \ rooms, and bedsteads, of which all the bedding consisted of grass mattresses.\
  \ The kitchen, with its shelves, on which rested the cooking utensils, its brick\
  \ stove, looked very well, and Neb worked away there as earnestly as if he was in\
  \ a chemist\u2019s laboratory.</p>"
- "<p>But the joiners had soon to be replaced by carpenters. In fact, the waterfall\
  \ created by the explosion rendered the construction of two bridges necessary, one\
  \ on Prospect Heights, the other on the shore. Now the plateau and the shore were\
  \ transversely divided by a watercourse, which had to be crossed to reach the northern\
  \ part of the island. To avoid it the colonists had been obliged to make a considerable\
  \ detour, by climbing up to the source of the Red Creek. The simplest thing was\
  \ to establish on the plateau, and on the shore, two bridges from twenty to five\
  \ and twenty feet in length. All the carpenter\u2019s work that was needed was to\
  \ clear some trees of their branches: this was a business of some days. Directly\
  \ the bridges were established, Neb and Pencroft profited by them to go to the oyster\u2011\
  bed which had been discovered near the downs. They dragged with them a sort of rough\
  \ cart, which replaced the former inconvenient hurdle, and brought back some thousands\
  \ of oysters, which soon increased among the rocks and formed a bed at the mouth\
  \ of the Mercy. These molluscs were of excellent quality, and the colonists consumed\
  \ some daily.</p>"
- <p>It has been seen that Lincoln Island, although its inhabitants had as yet only
  explored a small portion of it, already contributed to almost all their wants. It
  was probable that if they hunted into its most secret recesses, in all the wooded
  part between the Mercy and Reptile Point, they would find new treasures.</p>
- "<p>The settlers in Lincoln Island had still one privation. There was no want of\
  \ meat, nor of vegetable products; those ligneous roots which they had found, when\
  \ subjected to fermentation, gave them an acid drink, which was preferable to cold\
  \ water; they also made sugar, without canes or beet\u2011roots, by collecting the\
  \ liquor which distils from the \u201Cacer saceharinum,\u201D a sort of maple\u2011\
  tree, which flourishes in all the temperate zones, and of which the island possessed\
  \ a great number; they made a very agreeable tea by employing the herbs brought\
  \ from the warren; lastly, they had an abundance of salt, the only mineral which\
  \ is used in food... but bread was wanting.</p>"
- <p>Perhaps in time the settlers could replace this want by some equivalent, it was
  possible that they might find the sago or the breadfruit tree among the forests
  of the south, but they had not as yet met with these precious trees. However, Providence
  came directly to their aid, in an infinitesimal proportion it is true, but Cyrus
  Harding, with all his intelligence, all his ingenuity, would never have been able
  to produce that which, by the greatest chance, Herbert one day found in the lining
  of his waistcoat, which he was occupied in setting to rights.</p>
- <p>On this day, as it was raining in torrents, the settlers were assembled in the
  great hall in Granite House, when the lad cried out all at once,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CLook here, captain?A grain of corn!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And he showed his companions a grain?a single grain?which from a hole in his
  pocket had got into the lining of his waistcoat.</p>
- <p>The presence of this grain was explained by the fact that Herbert, when at Richmond,
  used to feed some pigeons, of which Pencroft had made him a present.</p>
- "<p>\u201CA grain of corn?\u201D said the engineer quickly.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, captain; but one, only one!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, my boy,\u201D said Pencroft, laughing, \u201Cwe\u2019re getting\
  \ on capitally, upon my word! What shall we make with one grain of corn?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe will make bread of it,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBread, cakes, tarts!\u201D replied the sailor. \u201CCome, the bread that\
  \ this grain of corn will make won\u2019t choke us very soon!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Herbert, not attaching much importance to his discovery, was going to throw\
  \ away the grain in question; but Harding took it, examined it, found that it was\
  \ in good condition, and looking the sailor full in the face?\u201CPencroft,\u201D\
  \ he asked quietly, \u201Cdo you know how many ears one grain of corn can produce?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201COne, I suppose!\u201D replied the sailor, surprised at the question.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTen, Pencroft! And do you know how many grains one ear bears?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, upon my word.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAbout eighty!\u201D said Cyrus Harding. \u201CThen, if we plant this grain,\
  \ at the first crop we shall reap eight hundred grains which at the second will\
  \ produce six hundred and forty thousand; at the third, five hundred and twelve\
  \ millions; at the fourth, more than four hundred thousands of millions! There is\
  \ the proportion.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Harding\u2019s companions listened without answering. These numbers astonished\
  \ them. They were exact, however.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, my friends,\u201D continued the engineer, \u201Csuch are the arithmetical\
  \ progressions of prolific nature; and yet what is this multiplication of the grain\
  \ of corn, of which the ear only bears eight hundred grains, compared to the poppy\u2011\
  plant, which bears thirty\u2011two thousand seeds; to the tobacco\u2011plant, which\
  \ produces three hundred and sixty thousand? In a few years, without the numerous\
  \ causes of destruction, which arrests their fecundity, these plants would overrun\
  \ the earth.\u201D</p>"
- <p>But the engineer had not finished his lecture.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAnd now, Pencroft,\u201D he continued, \u201Cdo you know how many bushels\
  \ four hundred thousand millions of grains would make?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied the sailor; \u201Cbut what I do know is, that I am nothing\
  \ better than a fool!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, they would make more than three millions, at a hundred and thirty\
  \ thousand a bushel, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThree millions!\u201D cried Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThree millions.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn four years?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn four years,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cand even in two years,\
  \ if, as I hope, in this latitude we can obtain two crops a year.\u201D</p>"
- <p>At that, according to his usual custom, Pencroft could not reply otherwise than
  by a tremendous hurrah.</p>
- "<p>\u201CSo, Herbert,\u201D added the engineer, \u201Cyou have made a discovery\
  \ of great importance to us. Everything, my friends, everything can serve us in\
  \ the condition in which we are. Do not forget that, I beg of you.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, captain, no, we shan\u2019t forget it,\u201D replied Pencroft; \u201C\
  and if ever I find one of those tobacco\u2011seeds, which multiply by three hundred\
  \ and sixty thousand, I assure you I won\u2019t throw it away! And now, what must\
  \ we do?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe must plant this grain,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D added Gideon Spilett, \u201Cand with every possible care, for\
  \ it bears in itself our future harvests.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CProvided it grows!\u201D cried the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt will grow,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- <p>This was the 20th of June. The time was then propitious for sowing this single
  precious grain of corn. It was first proposed to plant it in a pot, but upon reflection
  it was decided to leave it to nature, and confide it to the earth. This was done
  that very day, and it is needless to add, that every precaution was taken that the
  experiment might succeed.</p>
- <p>The weather having cleared, the settlers climbed the height above Granite House.
  There, on the plateau, they chose a spot, well sheltered from the wind, and exposed
  to all the heat of the midday sun. The place was cleared, carefully weeded, and
  searched for insects and worms; then a bed of good earth, improved with a little
  lime, was made; it was surrounded by a railing; and the grain was buried in the
  damp earth.</p>
- <p>Did it not seem as if the settlers were laying the first stone of some edifice?
  It recalled to Pencroft the day on which he lighted his only match, and all the
  anxiety of the operation. But this time the thing was more serious. In fact, the
  castaways would have been always able to procure fire, in some mode or other, but
  no human power could supply another grain of corn, if unfortunately this should
  be lost!</p>
- <p>Chapter 21</p>
- "<p>From this time Pencroft did not let a single day pass without going to visit\
  \ what he gravely called his \u201Ccorn\u2011field.\u201D And woe to the insects\
  \ which dared to venture there! No mercy was shown them.</p>"
- "<p>Towards the end of the month of June, after incessant rain, the weather became\
  \ decidedly colder, and on the 29th a Fahrenheit thermometer would certainly have\
  \ announced only twenty degrees above zero, that is considerably below the freezing\u2011\
  point. The next day, the 30th of June, the day which corresponds to the 31st of\
  \ December in the northern year, was a Friday. Neb remarked that the year finished\
  \ on a bad day, but Pencroft replied that naturally the next would begin on a good\
  \ one, which was better.</p>"
- <p>At any rate it commenced by very severe cold. Ice accumulated at the mouth of
  the Mercy, and it was not long before the whole expanse of the lake was frozen.</p>
- "<p>The settlers had frequently been obliged to renew their store of wood. Pencroft\
  \ also had wisely not waited till the river was frozen, but had brought enormous\
  \ rafts of wood to their destination. The current was an indefatigable moving power,\
  \ and it was employed in conveying the floating wood to the moment when the frost\
  \ enchained it. To the fuel which was so abundantly supplied by the forest, they\
  \ added several cartloads of coal, which had to be brought from the foot of the\
  \ spurs of Mount Franklin. The powerful heat of the coal was greatly appreciated\
  \ in the low temperature, which on the 4th of July fell to eight degrees of Fahrenheit,\
  \ that is, thirteen degrees below zero. A second fireplace had been established\
  \ in the dining\u2011room, where they all worked together at their different avocations.\
  \ During this period of cold, Cyrus Harding had great cause to congratulate himself\
  \ on having brought to Granite House the little stream of water from Lake Grant.\
  \ Taken below the frozen surface, and conducted through the passage, it preserved\
  \ its fluidity, and arrived at an interior reservoir which had been hollowed out\
  \ at the back part of the storeroom, while the overflow ran through the well to\
  \ the sea.</p>"
- "<p>About this time, the weather being extremely dry, the colonists, clothed as\
  \ warmly as possible, resolved to devote a day to the exploration of that part of\
  \ the island between the Mercy and Claw Cape. It was a wide extent of marshy land,\
  \ and they would probably find good sport, for water\u2011birds ought to swarm there.</p>"
- "<p>They reckoned that it would be about eight or nine miles to go there, and as\
  \ much to return, so that the whole of the day would be occupied. As an unknown\
  \ part of the island was about to be explored, the whole colony took part in the\
  \ expedition. Accordingly, on the 5th of July, at six o\u2019clock in the morning,\
  \ when day had scarcely broken, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and\
  \ Pencroft, armed with spears, snares, bows and arrows, and provided with provisions,\
  \ left Granite House, preceded by Top, who bounded before them.</p>"
- <p>Their shortest way was to cross the Mercy on the ice, which then covered it.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D as the engineer justly observed, \u201Cthat could not take\
  \ the place of a regular bridge!\u201D So, the construction of a regular bridge\
  \ was noted in the list of future works.</p>"
- <p>It was the first time that the settlers had set foot on the right bank of the
  Mercy, and ventured into the midst of those gigantic and superb coniferae now sprinkled
  over with snow.</p>
- <p>But they had not gone half a mile when from a thicket a whole family of quadrupeds,
  who had made a home there, disturbed by Top, rushed forth into the open country.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAh! I should say those are foxes!\u201D cried Herbert, when he saw the\
  \ troop rapidly decamping.</p>"
- <p>They were foxes, but of a very large size, who uttered a sort of barking, at
  which Top seemed to be very much astonished, for he stopped short in the chase,
  and gave the swift animals time to disappear.</p>
- "<p>The dog had reason to be surprised, as he did not know Natural History. But,\
  \ by their barking, these foxes, with reddish\u2011gray hair, black tails terminating\
  \ in a white tuft, had betrayed their origin. So Herbert was able, without hesitating,\
  \ to give them their real name of \u201CArctic foxes.\u201D They are frequently\
  \ met with in Chile, in the Falkland Islands, and in all parts of America traversed\
  \ by the thirtieth and fortieth parallels. Herbert much regretted that Top had not\
  \ been able to catch one of these carnivora.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAre they good to eat?\u201D asked Pencroft, who only regarded the representatives\
  \ of the fauna in the island from one special point of view.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Herbert; \u201Cbut zoologists have not yet found out\
  \ if the eye of these foxes is diurnal or nocturnal, or whether it is correct to\
  \ class them in the genus dog, properly so called.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Harding could not help smiling on hearing the lad\u2019s reflection, which showed\
  \ a thoughtful mind. As to the sailor, from the moment when he found that the foxes\
  \ were not classed in the genus eatable, they were nothing to him. However, when\
  \ a poultry\u2011yard was established at Granite House, he observed that it would\
  \ be best to take some precautions against a probable visit from these four\u2011\
  legged plunderers, and no one disputed this.</p>"
- "<p>After having turned the point, the settlers saw a long beach washed by the open\
  \ sea. It was then eight o\u2019clock in the morning. The sky was very clear, as\
  \ it often is after prolonged cold; but warmed by their walk, neither Harding nor\
  \ his companions felt the sharpness of the atmosphere too severely. Besides there\
  \ was no wind, which made it much more bearable. A brilliant sun, but without any\
  \ calorific action, was just issuing from the ocean. The sea was as tranquil and\
  \ blue as that of a Mediterranean gulf, when the sky is clear. Claw Cape, bent in\
  \ the form of a yataghan, tapered away nearly four miles to the southeast. To the\
  \ left the edge of the marsh was abruptly ended by a little point. Certainly, in\
  \ this part of Union Bay, which nothing sheltered from the open sea, not even a\
  \ sandbank, ships beaten by the east winds would have found no shelter. They perceived\
  \ by the tranquillity of the sea, in which no shallows troubled the waters, by its\
  \ uniform color, which was stained by no yellow shades, by the absence of even a\
  \ reef, that the coast was steep and that the ocean there covered a deep abyss.\
  \ Behind in the west, but at a distance of four miles, rose the first trees of the\
  \ forests of the Far West. They might have believed themselves to be on the desolate\
  \ coast of some island in the Antarctic regions which the ice had invaded. The colonists\
  \ halted at this place for breakfast. A fire of brushwood and dried seaweed was\
  \ lighted, and Neb prepared the breakfast of cold meat, to which he added some cups\
  \ of Oswego tea.</p>"
- <p>While eating they looked around them. This part of Lincoln Island was very sterile,
  and contrasted with all the western part. The reporter was thus led to observe that
  if chance had thrown them at first on the shore, they would have had but a deplorable
  idea of their future domain.</p>
- "<p>\u201CI believe that we should not have been able to reach it,\u201D replied\
  \ the engineer, \u201Cfor the sea is deep, and there is not a rock on which we could\
  \ have taken refuge. Before Granite House, at least, there were sandbanks, an islet,\
  \ which multiplied our chances of safety. Here, nothing but the depths!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is singular enough,\u201D remarked Spilett, \u201Cthat this comparatively\
  \ small island should present such varied ground. This diversity of aspect, logically\
  \ only belongs to continents of a certain extent. One would really say, that the\
  \ western part of Lincoln Island, so rich and so fertile, is washed by the warm\
  \ waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and that its shores to the north and the southeast\
  \ extend over a sort of Arctic sea.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are right, my dear Spilett,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201CI have\
  \ also observed this. I think the form and also the nature of this island strange.\
  \ It is a summary of all the aspects which a continent presents, and I should not\
  \ be surprised if it was a continent formerly.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat! a continent in the middle of the Pacific?\u201D cried Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy not?\u201D replied Cyrus Harding. \u201CWhy should not Australia,\
  \ New Ireland, Australasia, united to the archipelagoes of the Pacific, have once\
  \ formed a sixth part of the world, as important as Europe or Asia, as Africa or\
  \ the two Americas? To my mind, it is quite possible that all these islands, emerging\
  \ from this vast ocean, are but the summits of a continent, now submerged, but which\
  \ was above the waters at a prehistoric period.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAs the Atlantis was formerly,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, my boy... if, however, it existed.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd would Lincoln Island have been a part of that continent?\u201D asked\
  \ Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is probable,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cand that would sufficiently,\
  \ explain the variety of productions which are seen on its surface.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd the great number of animals which still inhabit it,\u201D added Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, my boy,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cand you furnish me with\
  \ an argument to support my theory. It is certain, after what we have seen, that\
  \ animals are numerous in this island, and what is more strange, that the species\
  \ are extremely varied. There is a reason for that, and to me it is that Lincoln\
  \ Island may have formerly been a part of some vast continent which had gradually\
  \ sunk below the Pacific.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen, some fine day,\u201D said Pencroft, who did not appear to be entirely\
  \ convinced, \u201Cthe rest of this ancient continent may disappear in its turn,\
  \ and there will be nothing between America and Asia.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Harding, \u201Cthere will be new continents which millions\
  \ and millions of animalculae are building at this moment.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd what are these masons?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCoral insects,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding. \u201CBy constant work they\
  \ made the island of Clermont\u2011Tonnerre, and numerous other coral islands in\
  \ the Pacific Ocean. Forty\u2011seven millions of these insects are needed to weigh\
  \ a grain, and yet, with the sea\u2011salt they absorb, the solid elements of water\
  \ which they assimilate, these animalculae produce limestone, and this limestone\
  \ forms enormous submarine erections, of which the hardness and solidity equal granite.\
  \ Formerly, at the first periods of creation, nature employing fire, heaved up the\
  \ land, but now she entrusts to these microscopic creatures the task of replacing\
  \ this agent, of which the dynamic power in the interior of the globe has evidently\
  \ diminished?which is proved by the number of volcanoes on the surface of the earth,\
  \ now actually extinct. And I believe that centuries succeeding to centuries, and\
  \ insects to insects, this Pacific may one day be changed into a vast continent,\
  \ which new generations will inhabit and civilize in their turn.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat will take a long time,\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNature has time for it,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut what would be the use of new continents?\u201D asked Herbert. \u201C\
  It appears to me that the present extent of habitable countries is sufficient for\
  \ humanity. Yet nature does nothing uselessly.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNothing uselessly, certainly,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cbut this\
  \ is how the necessity of new continents for the future, and exactly on the tropical\
  \ zone occupied by the coral islands, may be explained. At least to me this explanation\
  \ appears plausible.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe are listening, captain,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis is my idea: philosophers generally admit that some day our globe\
  \ will end, or rather that animal and vegetable life will no longer be possible,\
  \ because of the intense cold to which it will be subjected. What they are not agreed\
  \ upon, is the cause of this cold. Some think that it will arise from the falling\
  \ of the temperature, which the sun will experience after millions of years; others,\
  \ from the gradual extinction of the fires in the interior of our globe, which have\
  \ a greater influence on it than is generally supposed. I hold to this last hypothesis,\
  \ grounding it on the fact that the moon is really a cold star, which is no longer\
  \ habitable, although the sun continues to throw on its surface the same amount\
  \ of heat. If, then, the moon has become cold, it is because the interior fires\
  \ to which, as do all the stars of the stellar world, it owes its origin, are completely\
  \ extinct. Lastly, whatever may be the cause, our globe will become cold some day,\
  \ but this cold will only operate gradually. What will happen, then? The temperate\
  \ zones, at a more or less distant period, will not be more habitable than the polar\
  \ regions now are. Then the population of men, as well as the animals, will flow\
  \ towards the latitudes which are more directly under the solar influence. An immense\
  \ emigration will take place. Europe, Central Asia, North America, will gradually\
  \ be abandoned, as well as Australasia and the lower parts of South America. The\
  \ vegetation will follow the human emigration. The flora will retreat towards the\
  \ Equator at the same time as the fauna. The central parts of South America and\
  \ Africa will be the continents chiefly inhabited. The Laplanders and the Samoides\
  \ will find the climate of the polar regions on the shores of the Mediterranean.\
  \ Who can say, that at this period, the equatorial regions will not be too small,\
  \ to contain and nourish terrestrial humanity? Now, may not provident nature, so\
  \ as to give refuge to all the vegetable and animal emigration, be at present laying\
  \ the foundation of a new continent under the Equator, and may she not have entrusted\
  \ these insects with the construction of it? I have often thought of all these things,\
  \ my friends, and I seriously believe that the aspect of our globe will some day\
  \ be completely changed; that by the raising of new continents the sea will cover\
  \ the old, and that, in future ages, a Columbus will go to discover the islands\
  \ of Chimborazo, of the Himalayas, or of Mont Blanc, remains of a submerged America,\
  \ Asia, and Europe. Then these new continents will become, in their turn, uninhabitable;\
  \ heat will die away, as does the heat from a body when the soul has left it; and\
  \ life will disappear from the globe, if not for ever, at least for a period. Perhaps\
  \ then, our spheroid will rest?will be left to death?to revive some day under superior\
  \ conditions! But all that, my friends, is the secret of the Author of all things;\
  \ and beginning by the work of the insects, I have perhaps let myself be carried\
  \ too far, in investigating the secrets of the future.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy dear Cyrus,\u201D replied Spilett, \u201Cthese theories are prophecies\
  \ to me, and they will be accomplished some day.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is the secret of God,\u201D said the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAll that is well and good,\u201D then said Pencroft, who had listened\
  \ with all his might, \u201Cbut will you tell me, captain, if Lincoln Island has\
  \ been made by your insects?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Harding; \u201Cit is of a purely volcanic origin.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen it will disappear some day?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is probable.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI hope we won\u2019t be here then.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, don\u2019t be uneasy, Pencroft; we shall not be here then, as we have\
  \ no wish to die here, and hope to get away some time.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn the meantime,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, \u201Clet us establish\
  \ ourselves here as if forever. There is no use in doing things by halves.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>This ended the conversation. Breakfast was finished, the exploration was continued,\
  \ and the settlers arrived at the border of the marshy region. It was a marsh of\
  \ which the extent, to the rounded coast which terminated the island at the southeast,\
  \ was about twenty square miles. The soil was formed of clayey flint\u2011earth,\
  \ mingled with vegetable matter, such as the remains of rushes, reeds, grass, etc.\
  \ Here and there beds of grass, thick as a carpet, covered it. In many places icy\
  \ pools sparkled in the sun. Neither rain nor any river, increased by a sudden swelling,\
  \ could supply these ponds. They therefore naturally concluded that the marsh was\
  \ fed by the infiltrations of the soil and it was really so. It was also to be feared\
  \ that during the heat miasmas would arise, which might produce fevers.</p>"
- <p>Above the aquatic plants, on the surface of the stagnant water, fluttered numbers
  of birds. Wild duck, teal, snipe lived there in flocks, and those fearless birds
  allowed themselves to be easily approached.</p>
- <p>One shot from a gun would certainly have brought down some dozen of the birds,
  they were so close together. The explorers were, however, obliged to content themselves
  with bows and arrows. The result was less, but the silent arrow had the advantage
  of not frightening the birds, while the noise of firearms would have dispersed them
  to all parts of the marsh. The hunters were satisfied, for this time, with a dozen
  ducks, which had white bodies with a band of cinnamon, a green head, wings black,
  white, and red, and flattened beak. Herbert called them tadorns. Top helped in the
  capture of these birds, whose name was given to this marshy part of the island.
  The settlers had here an abundant reserve of aquatic game. At some future time they
  meant to explore it more carefully, and it was probable that some of the birds there
  might be domesticated, or at least brought to the shores of the lake, so that they
  would be more within their reach.</p>
- "<p>About five o\u2019clock in the evening Cyrus Harding and his companions retraced\
  \ their steps to their dwelling by traversing Tadorn\u2019s Fens, and crossed the\
  \ Mercy on the ice\u2011bridge.</p>"
- <p>At eight in the evening they all entered Granite House.</p>
- <p>Chapter 22</p>
- <p>This intense cold lasted till the 15th of August, without, however, passing the
  degree of Fahrenheit already mentioned. When the atmosphere was calm, the low temperature
  was easily borne, but when the wind blew, the poor settlers, insufficiently clothed,
  felt it severely. Pencroft regretted that Lincoln Island was not the home of a few
  families of bears rather than of so many foxes and seals.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBears,\u201D said he, \u201Care generally very well dressed, and I ask\
  \ no more than to borrow for the winter the warm cloaks which they have on their\
  \ backs.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D replied Neb, laughing, \u201Cperhaps the bears would not consent\
  \ to give you their cloaks, Pencroft. These beasts are not St. Martins.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe would make them do it, Neb, we would make them,\u201D replied Pencroft,\
  \ in quite an authoritative tone.</p>"
- <p>But these formidable carnivora did not exist in the island, or at any rate they
  had not yet shown themselves.</p>
- <p>In the meanwhile, Herbert, Pencroft, and the reporter occupied themselves with
  making traps on Prospect Heights and at the border of the forest.</p>
- <p>According to the sailor, any animal, whatever it was, would be a lawful prize,
  and the rodents or carnivora which might get into the new snares would be well received
  at Granite House.</p>
- <p>The traps were besides extremely simple; being pits dug in the ground, a platform
  of branches and grass above, which concealed the opening, and at the bottom some
  bait, the scent of which would attract animals. It must be mentioned also, that
  they had not been dug at random, but at certain places where numerous footprints
  showed that quadrupeds frequented the ground. They were visited every day, and at
  three different times, during the first days, specimens of those Antarctic foxes
  which they had already seen on the right bank of the Mercy were found in them.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhy, there are nothing but foxes in this country!\u201D cried Pencroft,\
  \ when for the third time he drew one of the animals out of the pit. Looking at\
  \ it in great disgust, he added, \u201Cbeasts which are good for nothing!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cthey are good for something!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd what is that?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo make bait to attract other creatures!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The reporter was right, and the traps were henceforward baited with the foxes
  carcasses.</p>
- <p>The sailor had also made snares from the long tough fibers of a certain plant,
  and they were even more successful than the traps. Rarely a day passed without some
  rabbits from the warren being caught. It was always rabbit, but Neb knew how to
  vary his sauces and the settlers did not think of complaining.</p>
- <p>However, once or twice in the second week of August, the traps supplied the hunters
  with other animals more useful than foxes, namely, several of those small wild boars
  which had already been seen to the north of the lake. Pencroft had no need to ask
  if these beasts were eatable. He could see that by their resemblance to the pig
  of America and Europe.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut these are not pigs,\u201D said Herbert to him, \u201CI warn you of\
  \ that, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy boy,\u201D replied the sailor, bending over the trap and drawing out\
  \ one of these representatives of the family of sus by the little appendage which\
  \ served it as a tail. \u201CLet me believe that these are pigs.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBecause that pleases me!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAre you very fond of pig then, Pencroft?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am very fond of pig,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cparticularly of\
  \ its feet, and if it had eight instead of four, I should like it twice as much!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>As to the animals in question, they were peccaries belonging to one of the four
  species which are included in the family, and they were also of the species of Tajacu,
  recognizable by their deep color and the absence of those long teeth with which
  the mouths of their congeners are armed. These peccaries generally live in herds,
  and it was probable that they abounded in the woody parts of the island.</p>
- <p>At any rate, they were eatable from head to foot, and Pencroft did not ask more
  from them.</p>
- <p>Towards the 15th of August, the state of the atmosphere was suddenly moderated
  by the wind shifting to the northwest. The temperature rose some degrees, and the
  accumulated vapor in the air was not long in resolving into snow. All the island
  was covered with a sheet of white, and showed itself to its inhabitants under a
  new aspect. The snow fell abundantly for several days, and it soon reached a thickness
  of two feet.</p>
- <p>The wind also blew with great violence, and at the height of Granite House the
  sea could be heard thundering against the reefs. In some places, the wind, eddying
  round the corners, formed the snow into tall whirling columns, resembling those
  waterspouts which turn round on their base, and which vessels attack with a shot
  from a gun. However, the storm, coming from the northwest, blew across the island,
  and the position of Granite House preserved it from a direct attack.</p>
- "<p>But in the midst of this snow\u2011storm, as terrible as if it had been produced\
  \ in some polar country, neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions could, notwithstanding\
  \ their wish for it, venture forth, and they remained shut up for five days, from\
  \ the 20th to the 25th of August. They could hear the tempest raging in Jacamar\
  \ Wood, which would surely suffer from it. Many of the trees would no doubt be torn\
  \ up by the roots, but Pencroft consoled himself by thinking that he would not have\
  \ the trouble of cutting them down.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe wind is turning woodman, let it alone,\u201D he repeated.</p>"
- <p>Besides, there was no way of stopping it, if they had wished to do so.</p>
- <p>How grateful the inhabitants of Granite House then were to Heaven for having
  prepared for them this solid and immovable retreat! Cyrus Harding had also his legitimate
  share of thanks, but after all, it was Nature who had hollowed out this vast cavern,
  and he had only discovered it. There all were in safety, and the tempest could not
  reach them. If they had constructed a house of bricks and wood on Prospect Heights,
  it certainly would not have resisted the fury of this storm. As to the Chimneys,
  it must have been absolutely uninhabitable, for the sea, passing over the islet,
  would beat furiously against it. But here, in Granite House, in the middle of a
  solid mass, over which neither the sea nor air had any influence, there was nothing
  to fear.</p>
- <p>During these days of seclusion the settlers did not remain inactive.</p>
- <p>There was no want of wood, cut up into planks, in the storeroom, and little by
  little they completed their furnishing; constructing the most solid of tables and
  chairs, for material was not spared. Neb and Pencroft were very proud of this rather
  heavy furniture, which they would not have changed on any account.</p>
- "<p>Then the carpenters became basket\u2011makers, and they did not succeed badly\
  \ in this new manufacture. At the point of the lake which projected to the north,\
  \ they had discovered an osier\u2011bed in which grew a large number of purple osiers.\
  \ Before the rainy season, Pencroft and Herbert had cut down these useful shrubs,\
  \ and their branches, well prepared, could now be effectively employed. The first\
  \ attempts were somewhat crude, but in consequence of the cleverness and intelligence\
  \ of the workmen, by consulting, and recalling the models which they had seen, and\
  \ by emulating each other, the possessions of the colony were soon increased by\
  \ several baskets of different sizes. The storeroom was provided with them, and\
  \ in special baskets Neb placed his collection of rhizomes, stone\u2011pine almonds,\
  \ etc.</p>"
- <p>During the last week of the month of August the weather moderated again. The
  temperature fell a little, and the tempest abated. The colonists sallied out directly.
  There was certainly two feet of snow on the shore, but they were able to walk without
  much difficulty on the hardened surface. Cyrus Harding and his companions climbed
  Prospect Heights.</p>
- <p>What a change! The woods, which they had left green, especially in the part at
  which the firs predominated, had disappeared under a uniform color. All was white,
  from the summit of Mount Franklin to the shore, the forests, the plains, the lake,
  the river. The waters of the Mercy flowed under a roof of ice, which, at each rising
  and ebbing of the tide, broke up with loud crashes. Numerous birds fluttered over
  the frozen surface of the lake. Ducks and snipe, teal and guillemots were assembled
  in thousands. The rocks among which the cascade flowed were bristling with icicles.
  One might have said that the water escaped by a monstrous gargoyle, shaped with
  all the imagination of an artist of the Renaissance. As to the damage caused by
  the storm in the forest, that could not as yet be ascertained; they would have to
  wait till the snowy covering was dissipated.</p>
- "<p>Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert did not miss this opportunity of going\
  \ to visit their traps. They did not find them easily, under the snow with which\
  \ they were covered. They had also to be careful not to fall into one or other of\
  \ them, which would have been both dangerous and humiliating; to be taken in their\
  \ own snares! But happily they avoided this unpleasantness, and found their traps\
  \ perfectly intact. No animal had fallen into them, and yet the footprints in the\
  \ neighborhood were very numerous, among others, certain very clear marks of claws.\
  \ Herbert did not hesitate to affirm that some animal of the feline species had\
  \ passed there, which justified the engineer\u2019s opinion that dangerous beasts\
  \ existed in Lincoln Island. These animals doubtless generally lived in the forests\
  \ of the Far West, but pressed by hunger, they had ventured as far as Prospect Heights.\
  \ Perhaps they had smelled out the inhabitants of Granite House. \u201CNow, what\
  \ are these feline creatures?\u201D asked Pencroft. \u201CThey are tigers,\u201D\
  \ replied Herbert. \u201CI thought those beasts were only found in hot countries?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201COn the new continent,\u201D replied the lad, \u201Cthey are found from\
  \ Mexico to the Pampas of Buenos Aires. Now, as Lincoln Island is nearly under the\
  \ same latitude as the provinces of La Plata, it is not surprising that tigers are\
  \ to be met with in it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, we must look out for them,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>However, the snow soon disappeared, quickly dissolving under the influence of\
  \ the rising temperature. Rain fell, and the sheet of white soon vanished. Notwithstanding\
  \ the bad weather, the settlers renewed their stores of different things, stone\u2011\
  pine almonds, rhizomes, syrup from the maple\u2011tree, for the vegetable part;\
  \ rabbits from the warren, agouties, and kangaroos for the animal part. This necessitated\
  \ several excursions into the forest, and they found that a great number of trees\
  \ had been blown down by the last hurricane. Pencroft and Neb also pushed with the\
  \ cart as far as the vein of coal, and brought back several tons of fuel. They saw\
  \ in passing that the pottery kiln had been severely damaged by the wind, at least\
  \ six feet of it having been blown off.</p>"
- <p>At the same time as the coal, the store of wood was renewed at Granite House,
  and they profited by the current of the Mercy having again become free, to float
  down several rafts. They could see that the cold period was not ended.</p>
- <p>A visit was also paid to the Chimneys, and the settlers could not but congratulate
  themselves on not having been living there during the hurricane. The sea had left
  unquestionable traces of its ravages. Sweeping over the islet, it had furiously
  assailed the passages, half filling them with sand, while thick beds of seaweed
  covered the rocks. While Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft hunted or collected wood, Cyrus
  Harding and Gideon Spilett busied themselves in putting the Chimneys to rights,
  and they found the forge and the bellows almost unhurt, protected as they had been
  from the first by the heaps of sand.</p>
- <p>The store of fuel had not been made uselessly. The settlers had not done with
  the rigorous cold. It is known that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the month of February
  is principally distinguished by rapid fallings of the temperature. It is the same
  in the Southern Hemisphere, and the end of the month of August, which is the February
  of North America, does not escape this climatic law.</p>
- "<p>About the 25th, after another change from snow to rain, the wind shifted to\
  \ the southeast, and the cold became, suddenly, very severe. According to the engineer\u2019\
  s calculation, the mercurial column of a Fahrenheit thermometer would not have marked\
  \ less than eight degrees below zero, and this intense cold, rendered still more\
  \ painful by a sharp gale, lasted for several days. The colonists were again shut\
  \ up in Granite House, and as it was necessary to hermetically seal all the openings\
  \ of the facade, only leaving a narrow passage for renewing the air, the consumption\
  \ of candles was considerable. To economize them, the cavern was often only lighted\
  \ by the blazing hearths, on which fuel was not spared. Several times, one or other\
  \ of the settlers descended to the beach in the midst of ice which the waves heaped\
  \ up at each tide, but they soon climbed up again to Granite House, and it was not\
  \ without pain and difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of the ladder.\
  \ In consequence of the intense cold, their fingers felt as if burned when they\
  \ touched the rounds. To occupy the leisure hours, which the tenants of Granite\
  \ House now had at their disposal, Cyrus Harding undertook an operation which could\
  \ be performed indoors.</p>"
- <p>We know that the settlers had no other sugar at their disposal than the liquid
  substance which they drew from the maple, by making deep incisions in the tree.
  They contented themselves with collecting this liquor in jars and employing it in
  this state for different culinary purposes, and the more so, as on growing old,
  this liquid began to become white and to be of a syrupy consistence.</p>
- <p>But there was something better to be made of it, and one day Cyrus Harding announced
  that they were going to turn into refiners.</p>
- "<p>\u201CRefiners!\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201CThat is rather a warm trade, I\
  \ think.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery warm,\u201D answered the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen it will be seasonable!\u201D said the sailor.</p>"
- <p>This word refining need not awake in the mind thoughts of an elaborate manufactory
  with apparatus and numerous workmen. No! to crystallize this liquor, only an extremely
  easy operation is required. Placed on the fire in large earthen pots, it was simply
  subjected to evaporation, and soon a scum arose to its surface. As soon as this
  began to thicken, Neb carefully removed it with a wooden spatula; this accelerated
  the evaporation, and at the same time prevented it from contracting an empyreumatic
  flavor.</p>
- <p>After boiling for several hours on a hot fire, which did as much good to the
  operators as the substance operated upon, the latter was transformed into a thick
  syrup. This syrup was poured into clay molds, previously fabricated in the kitchen
  stove, and to which they had given various shapes. The next day this syrup had become
  cold, and formed cakes and tablets. This was sugar of rather a reddish color, but
  nearly transparent and of a delicious taste.</p>
- <p>The cold continued to the middle of September, and the prisoners in Granite House
  began to find their captivity rather tedious. Nearly every day they attempted sorties
  which they could not prolong. They constantly worked at the improvement of their
  dwelling. They talked while working. Harding instructed his companions in many things,
  principally explaining to them the practical applications of science. The colonists
  had no library at their disposal; but the engineer was a book which was always at
  hand, always open at the page which one wanted, a book which answered all their
  questions, and which they often consulted. The time thus passed away pleasantly,
  these brave men not appearing to have any fears for the future.</p>
- "<p>However, all were anxious to see, if not the fine season, at least the cessation\
  \ of the insupportable cold. If only they had been clothed in a way to meet it,\
  \ how many excursions they would have attempted, either to the downs or to Tadorn\u2019\
  s Fens! Game would have been easily approached, and the chase would certainly have\
  \ been most productive. But Cyrus Harding considered it of importance that no one\
  \ should injure his health, for he had need of all his hands, and his advice was\
  \ followed.</p>"
- <p>But it must be said, that the one who was most impatient of this imprisonment,
  after Pencroft perhaps, was Top. The faithful dog found Granite House very narrow.
  He ran backwards and forwards from one room to another, showing in his way how weary
  he was of being shut up. Harding often remarked that when he approached the dark
  well which communicated with the sea, and of which the orifice opened at the back
  of the storeroom, Top uttered singular growlings. He ran round and round this hole,
  which had been covered with a wooden lid. Sometimes even he tried to put his paws
  under the lid, as if he wished to raise it. He then yelped in a peculiar way, which
  showed at once anger and uneasiness.</p>
- <p>The engineer observed this maneuver several times.</p>
- "<p>What could there be in this abyss to make such an impression on the intelligent\
  \ animal? The well led to the sea, that was certain. Could narrow passages spread\
  \ from it through the foundations of the island? Did some marine monster come from\
  \ time to time, to breathe at the bottom of this well? The engineer did not know\
  \ what to think, and could not refrain from dreaming of many strange improbabilities.\
  \ Accustomed to go far into the regions of scientific reality, he would not allow\
  \ himself to be drawn into the regions of the strange and almost of the supernatural;\
  \ but yet how to explain why Top, one of those sensible dogs who never waste their\
  \ time in barking at the moon, should persist in trying with scent and hearing to\
  \ fathom this abyss, if there was nothing there to cause his uneasiness? Top\u2019\
  s conduct puzzled Cyrus Harding even more than he cared to acknowledge to himself.</p>"
- "<p>At all events, the engineer only communicated his impressions to Gideon Spilett,\
  \ for he thought it useless to explain to his companions the suspicions which arose\
  \ from what perhaps was only Top\u2019s fancy.</p>"
- <p>At last the cold ceased. There had been rain, squalls mingled with snow, hailstorms,
  gusts of wind, but these inclemencies did not last. The ice melted, the snow disappeared;
  the shore, the plateau, the banks of the Mercy, the forest, again became practicable.
  This return of spring delighted the tenants of Granite House, and they soon only
  passed in it the hours necessary for eating and sleeping.</p>
- <p>They hunted much in the second part of September, which led Pencroft to again
  entreat for the firearms, which he asserted had been promised by Cyrus Harding.
  The latter, knowing well that without special tools it would be nearly impossible
  for him to manufacture a gun which would be of any use, still drew back and put
  off the operation to some future time, observing in his usual dry way, that Herbert
  and Spilett had become very skilful archers, so that many sorts of excellent animals,
  agouties, kangaroos, capybaras, pigeons, bustards, wild ducks, snipes, in short,
  game both with fur and feathers, fell victims to their arrows, and that, consequently,
  they could wait. But the obstinate sailor would listen to nothing of this, and he
  would give the engineer no peace till he promised to satisfy his desire. Gideon
  Spilett, however, supported Pencroft.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIf, which may be doubted,\u201D said he, \u201Cthe island is inhabited\
  \ by wild beasts, we must think how to fight with and exterminate them. A time may\
  \ come when this will be our first duty.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>But at this period, it was not the question of firearms which occupied Harding,\
  \ but that of clothes. Those which the settlers wore had passed this winter, but\
  \ they would not last until next winter. Skins of carnivora or the wool of ruminants\
  \ must be procured at any price, and since there were plenty of musmons, it was\
  \ agreed to consult on the means of forming a flock which might be brought up for\
  \ the use of the colony. An enclosure for the domestic animals, a poultry\u2011\
  yard for the birds, in a word to establish a sort of farm in the island, such were\
  \ the two important projects for the fine season.</p>"
- <p>In consequence and in view of these future establishments, it became of much
  importance that they should penetrate into all the yet unknown parts of Lincoln
  Island, that is to say, through that thick forest which extended on the right bank
  of the Mercy, from its mouth to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula, as well
  as on the whole of its western side. But this needed settled weather, and a month
  must pass before this exploration could be profitably undertaken.</p>
- <p>They therefore waited with some impatience, when an incident occurred which increased
  the desire the settlers had to visit the whole of their domain.</p>
- <p>It was the 24th of October. On this day, Pencroft had gone to visit his traps,
  which he always kept properly baited. In one of them he found three animals which
  would be very welcome for the larder. They were a female peccary and her two young
  ones.</p>
- <p>Pencroft then returned to Granite House, enchanted with his capture, and, as
  usual, he made a great show of his game.</p>
- "<p>\u201CCome, we shall have a grand feast, captain!\u201D he exclaimed. \u201C\
  And you too, Mr. Spilett, you will eat some!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI shall be very happy,\u201D replied the reporter; \u201Cbut what is it\
  \ that I am going to eat?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSuckling\u2011pig.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh, indeed, suckling\u2011pig, Pencroft? To hear you, I thought that you\
  \ were bringing back a young partridge stuffed with truffles!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat?\u201D cried Pencroft. \u201CDo you mean to say that you turn up\
  \ your nose at suckling\u2011pig?\u2019</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, without showing any enthusiasm; \u201C\
  provided one doesn\u2019t eat too much.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right,\u201D returned the sailor, who was\
  \ not pleased whenever he heard his chase made light of. \u201CYou like to make\
  \ objections. Seven months ago, when we landed on the island, you would have been\
  \ only too glad to have met with such game!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, well,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Cman is never perfect, nor\
  \ contented.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNow,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201CI hope that Neb will distinguish himself.\
  \ Look here! These two little peccaries are not more than three months old! They\
  \ will be as tender as quails! Come along, Neb, come! I will look after the cooking\
  \ myself.\u201D</p>"
- <p>And the sailor, followed by Neb, entered the kitchen, where they were soon absorbed
  in their culinary labors.</p>
- "<p>They were allowed to do it in their own way. Neb, therefore, prepared a magnificent\
  \ repast?the two little peccaries, kangaroo soup, a smoked ham, stone\u2011pine\
  \ almonds, Oswego tea; in fact, all the best that they had, but among all the dishes\
  \ figured in the first rank the savory peccaries.</p>"
- "<p>At five o\u2019clock dinner was served in the dining\u2011room of Granite House.\
  \ The kangaroo soup was smoking on the table. They found it excellent.</p>"
- <p>To the soup succeeded the peccaries, which Pencroft insisted on carving himself,
  and of which he served out monstrous portions to each of the guests.</p>
- "<p>These suckling\u2011pigs were really delicious, and Pencroft was devouring his\
  \ share with great gusto, when all at once a cry and an oath escaped him.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201D asked Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe matter? the matter is that I have just broken a tooth!\u201D replied\
  \ the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat, are there pebbles in your peccaries?\u201D said Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI suppose so,\u201D replied Pencroft, drawing from his lips the object\
  \ which had cost him a grinder?!</p>"
- <p>It was not a pebble?it was a leaden bullet.</p>
- <p>PART 2. ABANDONED</p>
- <p>Chapter 1</p>
- <p>It was now exactly seven months since the balloon voyagers had been thrown on
  Lincoln Island. During that time, notwithstanding the researches they had made,
  no human being had been discovered. No smoke even had betrayed the presence of man
  on the surface of the island. No vestiges of his handiwork showed that either at
  an early or at a late period had man lived there. Not only did it now appear to
  be uninhabited by any but themselves, but the colonists were compelled to believe
  that it never had been inhabited. And now, all this scaffolding of reasonings fell
  before a simple ball of metal, found in the body of an inoffensive rodent! In fact,
  this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who but a human being could have
  used such a weapon?</p>
- <p>When Pencroft had placed the bullet on the table, his companions looked at it
  with intense astonishment. All the consequences likely to result from this incident,
  notwithstanding its apparent insignificance, immediately took possession of their
  minds. The sudden apparition of a supernatural being could not have startled them
  more completely.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding did not hesitate to give utterance to the suggestions which this
  fact, at once surprising and unexpected, could not fail to raise in his mind. He
  took the bullet, turned it over and over, rolled it between his finger and thumb;
  then, turning to Pencroft, he asked,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CAre you sure that the peccary wounded by this bullet was not more than\
  \ three months old?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNot more, captain,\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201CIt was still sucking\
  \ its mother when I found it in the trap.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D said the engineer, \u201Cthat proves that within three months\
  \ a gun\u2011shot was fired in Lincoln Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd that a bullet,\u201D added Gideon Spilett, \u201Cwounded, though not\
  \ mortally, this little animal.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is unquestionable,\u201D said Cyrus Harding, \u201Cand these are\
  \ the deductions which must be drawn from this incident: that the island was inhabited\
  \ before our arrival, or that men have landed here within three months. Did these\
  \ men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by disembarking on the shore or\
  \ by being wrecked? This point can only be cleared up later. As to what they were,\
  \ Europeans or Malays, enemies or friends of our race, we cannot possibly guess;\
  \ and if they still inhabit the island, or if they have left it, we know not. But\
  \ these questions are of too much importance to be allowed to remain long unsettled.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo! a hundred times no! a thousand times no!\u201D cried the sailor, springing\
  \ up from the table. \u201CThere are no other men than ourselves on Lincoln Island!\
  \ By my faith! The island isn\u2019t large and if it had been inhabited, we should\
  \ have seen some of the inhabitants long before this!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn fact, the contrary would be very astonishing,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut it would be much more astonishing, I should think,\u201D observed\
  \ the reporter, \u201Cif this peccary had been born with a bullet in its inside!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt least,\u201D said Neb seriously, \u201Cif Pencroft has not had?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CLook here, Neb,\u201D burst out Pencroft. \u201CDo you think I could have\
  \ a bullet in my jaw for five or six months without finding it out? Where could\
  \ it be hidden?\u201D he asked, opening his mouth to show the two\u2011and\u2011\
  thirty teeth with which it was furnished. \u201CLook well, Neb, and if you find\
  \ one hollow tooth in this set, I will let you pull out half a dozen!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNeb\u2019s supposition is certainly inadmissible,\u201D replied Harding,\
  \ who, notwithstanding the gravity of his thoughts, could not restrain a smile.\
  \ \u201CIt is certain that a gun has been fired in the island, within three months\
  \ at most. But I am inclined to think that the people who landed on this coast were\
  \ only here a very short time ago, or that they just touched here; for if, when\
  \ we surveyed the island from the summit of Mount Franklin, it had been inhabited,\
  \ we should have seen them or we should have been seen ourselves. It is therefore,\
  \ probable that within only a few weeks castaways have been thrown by a storm on\
  \ some part of the coast. However that may be, it is of consequence to us to have\
  \ this point settled.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI think that we should act with caution,\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSuch is my advice,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cfor it is to be\
  \ feared that Malay pirates have landed on the island!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain,\u201D asked the sailor, \u201Cwould it not be a good plan, before\
  \ setting out, to build a canoe in which we could either ascend the river, or, if\
  \ we liked, coast round the inland? It will not do to be unprovided.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYour idea is good, Pencroft,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cbut we\
  \ cannot wait for that. It would take at least a month to build a boat.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, a real boat,\u201D replied the sailor; \u201Cbut we do not want one\
  \ for a sea voyage, and in five days at the most, I will undertake to construct\
  \ a canoe fit to navigate the Mercy.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFive days,\u201D cried Neb, \u201Cto build a boat?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Neb; a boat in the Indian fashion.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COf wood?\u201D asked the Negro, looking still unconvinced.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COf wood,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cor rather of bark. I repeat, captain,\
  \ that in five days the work will be finished!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn five days, then, be it,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut till that time we must be very watchful,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery watchful indeed, my friends,\u201D replied Harding; \u201Cand I beg\
  \ you to confine your hunting excursions to the neighborhood of Granite House.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The dinner ended less gaily than Pencroft had hoped.</p>
- <p>So, then, the island was, or had been, inhabited by others than the settlers.
  Proved as it was by the incident of the bullet, it was hereafter an unquestionable
  fact, and such a discovery could not but cause great uneasiness among the colonists.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, before sleeping, conversed long about the matter.
  They asked themselves if by chance this incident might not have some connection
  with the inexplicable way in which the engineer had been saved, and the other peculiar
  circumstances which had struck them at different times. However, Cyrus Harding,
  after having discussed the pros and cons of the question, ended by saying,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CIn short, would you like to know my opinion, my dear Spilett?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Cyrus.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, then, it is this: however minutely we explore the island, we shall\
  \ find nothing.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The next day Pencroft set to work. He did not mean to build a boat with boards\
  \ and planking, but simply a flat\u2011bottomed canoe, which would be well suited\
  \ for navigating the Mercy?above all, for approaching its source, where the water\
  \ would naturally be shallow. Pieces of bark, fastened one to the other, would form\
  \ a light boat; and in case of natural obstacles, which would render a portage necessary,\
  \ it would be easily carried. Pencroft intended to secure the pieces of bark by\
  \ means of nails, to insure the canoe being water\u2011tight.</p>"
- "<p>It was first necessary to select the trees which would afford a strong and supple\
  \ bark for the work. Now the last storm had brought down a number of large birch\u2011\
  trees, the bark of which would be perfectly suited for their purpose. Some of these\
  \ trees lay on the ground, and they had only to be barked, which was the most difficult\
  \ thing of all, owing to the imperfect tools which the settlers possessed. However,\
  \ they overcame all difficulties.</p>"
- <p>While the sailor, seconded by the engineer, thus occupied himself without losing
  an hour, Gideon Spilett and Herbert were not idle.</p>
- "<p>They were made purveyors to the colony. The reporter could not but admire the\
  \ boy, who had acquired great skill in handling the bow and spear. Herbert also\
  \ showed great courage and much of that presence of mind which may justly be called\
  \ \u201Cthe reasoning of bravery.\u201D These two companions of the chase, remembering\
  \ Cyrus Harding\u2019s recommendations, did not go beyond a radius of two miles\
  \ round Granite House; but the borders of the forest furnished a sufficient tribute\
  \ of agoutis, capybaras, kangaroos, peccaries, etc.; and if the result from the\
  \ traps was less than during the cold, still the warren yielded its accustomed quota,\
  \ which might have fed all the colony in Lincoln Island.</p>"
- "<p>Often during these excursions, Herbert talked with Gideon Spilett on the incident\
  \ of the bullet, and the deductions which the engineer drew from it, and one day?it\
  \ was the 26th of October?he said?\u201CBut, Mr. Spilett, do you not think it very\
  \ extraordinary that, if any castaways have landed on the island, they have not\
  \ yet shown themselves near Granite House?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery astonishing if they are still here,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201C\
  but not astonishing at all if they are here no longer!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSo you think that these people have already quitted the island?\u201D\
  \ returned Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is more than probable, my boy; for if their stay was prolonged, and\
  \ above all, if they were still here, some accident would have at last betrayed\
  \ their presence.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut if they were able to go away,\u201D observed the lad, \u201Cthey could\
  \ not have been castaways.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Herbert; or, at least, they were what might be called provisional\
  \ castaways. It is very possible that a storm may have driven them to the island\
  \ without destroying their vessel, and that, the storm over, they went away again.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CI must acknowledge one thing,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cit is that Captain\
  \ Harding appears rather to fear than desire the presence of human beings on our\
  \ island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn short,\u201D responded the reporter, \u201Cthere are only Malays who\
  \ frequent these seas, and those fellows are ruffians which it is best to avoid.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is not impossible, Mr. Spilett,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cthat some\
  \ day or other we may find traces of their landing.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI do not say no, my boy. A deserted camp, the ashes of a fire, would put\
  \ us on the track, and this is what we will look for in our next expedition.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The day on which the hunters spoke thus, they were in a part of the forest near
  the Mercy, remarkable for its beautiful trees. There, among others, rose, to a height
  of nearly 200 feet above the ground, some of those superb coniferae, to which, in
  New Zealand, the natives give the name of Kauris.</p>
- "<p>\u201CI have an idea, Mr. Spilett,\u201D said Herbert. \u201CIf I were to climb\
  \ to the top of one of these kauris, I could survey the country for an immense distance\
  \ round.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe idea is good,\u201D replied the reporter; \u201Cbut could you climb\
  \ to the top of those giants?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI can at least try,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- <p>The light and active boy then sprang on the first branches, the arrangement of
  which made the ascent of the kauri easy, and in a few minutes he arrived at the
  summit, which emerged from the immense plain of verdure.</p>
- <p>From this elevated situation his gaze extended over all the southern portion
  of the island, from Claw Cape on the southeast, to Reptile End on the southwest.
  To the northwest rose Mount Franklin, which concealed a great part of the horizon.</p>
- <p>But Herbert, from the height of his observatory, could examine all the yet unknown
  portion of the island, which might have given shelter to the strangers whose presence
  they suspected.</p>
- <p>The lad looked attentively. There was nothing in sight on the sea, not a sail,
  neither on the horizon nor near the island. However, as the bank of trees hid the
  shore, it was possible that a vessel, especially if deprived of her masts, might
  lie close to the land and thus be invisible to Herbert.</p>
- <p>Neither in the forests of the Far West was anything to be seen. The wood formed
  an impenetrable screen, measuring several square miles, without a break or an opening.
  It was impossible even to follow the course of the Mercy, or to ascertain in what
  part of the mountain it took its source. Perhaps other creeks also ran towards the
  west, but they could not be seen.</p>
- "<p>But at last, if all indication of an encampment escaped Herbert\u2019s sight\
  \ could he not even catch a glimpse of smoke, the faintest trace of which would\
  \ be easily discernible in the pure atmosphere?</p>"
- <p>For an instant Herbert thought he could perceive a slight smoke in the west,
  but a more attentive examination showed that he was mistaken. He strained his eyes
  in every direction, and his sight was excellent. No, decidedly there was nothing
  there.</p>
- "<p>Herbert descended to the foot of the kauri, and the two sportsmen returned to\
  \ Granite House. There Cyrus Harding listened to the lad\u2019s account, shook his\
  \ head and said nothing. It was very evident that no decided opinion could be pronounced\
  \ on this question until after a complete exploration of the island.</p>"
- <p>Two days after?the 28th of October?another incident occurred, for which an explanation
  was again required.</p>
- <p>While strolling along the shore about two miles from Granite House, Herbert and
  Neb were fortunate enough to capture a magnificent specimen of the order of chelonia.
  It was a turtle of the species Midas, the edible green turtle, so called from the
  color both of its shell and fat.</p>
- <p>Herbert caught sight of this turtle as it was crawling among the rocks to reach
  the sea.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHelp, Neb, help!\u201D he cried.</p>"
- <p>Neb ran up.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat a fine animal!\u201D said Neb; \u201Cbut how are we to catch it?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNothing is easier, Neb,\u201D replied Herbert. \u201CWe have only to turn\
  \ the turtle on its back, and it cannot possibly get away. Take your spear and do\
  \ as I do.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The reptile, aware of danger, had retired between its carapace and plastron.
  They no longer saw its head or feet, and it was motionless as a rock.</p>
- <p>Herbert and Neb then drove their sticks underneath the animal, and by their united
  efforts managed without difficulty to turn it on its back. The turtle, which was
  three feet in length, would have weighed at least four hundred pounds.</p>
- "<p>\u201CCapital!\u201D cried Neb; \u201Cthis is something which will rejoice friend\
  \ Pencroft\u2019s heart.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>In fact, the heart of friend Pencroft could not fail to be rejoiced, for the\
  \ flesh of the turtle, which feeds on wrack\u2011grass, is extremely savory. At\
  \ this moment the creature\u2019s head could be seen, which was small, flat, but\
  \ widened behind by the large temporal fossae hidden under the long roof.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd now, what shall we do with our prize?\u201D said Neb. \u201CWe can\u2019\
  t drag it to Granite House!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLeave it here, since it cannot turn over,\u201D replied Herbert, \u201C\
  and we will come back with the cart to fetch it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is the best plan.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>However, for greater precaution, Herbert took the trouble, which Neb deemed\
  \ superfluous, to wedge up the animal with great stones; after which the two hunters\
  \ returned to Granite House, following the beach, which the tide had left uncovered.\
  \ Herbert, wishing to surprise Pencroft, said nothing about the \u201Csuperb specimen\
  \ of a chelonian\u201D which they had turned over on the sand; but, two hours later,\
  \ he and Neb returned with the cart to the place where they had left it. The \u201C\
  superb specimen of a chelonian\u201D was no longer there!</p>"
- <p>Neb and Herbert stared at each other first; then they stared about them. It was
  just at this spot that the turtle had been left. The lad even found the stones which
  he had used, and therefore he was certain of not being mistaken.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell!\u201D said Neb, \u201Cthese beasts can turn themselves over, then?\u2019\
  \u2019</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt appears so,\u201D replied Herbert, who could not understand it at all,\
  \ and was gazing at the stones scattered on the sand.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, Pencroft will be disgusted!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd Captain Harding will perhaps be very perplexed how to explain this\
  \ disappearance,\u201D thought Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLook here,\u201D said Neb, who wished to hide his ill\u2011luck, \u201C\
  we won\u2019t speak about it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COn the contrary, Neb, we must speak about it,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- <p>And the two, taking the cart, which there was now no use for, returned to Granite
  House.</p>
- <p>Arrived at the dockyard, where the engineer and the sailor were working together,
  Herbert recounted what had happened.</p>
- "<p>\u201COh! the stupids!\u201D cried the sailor, \u201Cto have let at least fifty\
  \ meals escape!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, Pencroft,\u201D replied Neb, \u201Cit wasn\u2019t our fault that\
  \ the beast got away; as I tell you, we had turned it over on its back!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen you didn\u2019t turn it over enough!\u201D returned the obstinate\
  \ sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNot enough!\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- <p>And he told how he had taken care to wedge up the turtle with stones.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is a miracle, then!\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI thought, captain,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cthat turtles, once placed\
  \ on their backs, could not regain their feet, especially when they are of a large\
  \ size?\u2019</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is true, my boy,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen how did it manage?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt what distance from the sea did you leave this turtle?\u201D asked the\
  \ engineer, who, having suspended his work, was reflecting on this incident.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFifteen feet at the most,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd the tide was low at the time?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, captain.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cwhat the turtle could not do on\
  \ the sand it might have been able to do in the water. It turned over when the tide\
  \ overtook it, and then quietly returned to the deep sea.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh! what stupids we were!\u201D cried Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is precisely what I had the honor of telling you before!\u201D returned\
  \ the sailor.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding had given this explanation, which, no doubt, was admissible. But
  was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this explanation? It cannot be said
  that he was.</p>
- <p>Chapter 2</p>
- <p>On the 9th of October the bark canoe was entirely finished. Pencroft had kept
  his promise, and a light boat, the shell of which was joined together by the flexible
  twigs of the crejimba, had been constructed in five days. A seat in the stern, a
  second seat in the middle to preserve the equilibrium, a third seat in the bows,
  rowlocks for the two oars, a scull to steer with, completed the little craft, which
  was twelve feet long, and did not weigh more than two hundred pounds. The operation
  of launching it was extremely simple. The canoe was carried to the beach and laid
  on the sand before Granite House, and the rising tide floated it. Pencroft, who
  leaped in directly, maneuvered it with the scull and declared it to be just the
  thing for the purpose to which they wished to put it.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHurrah!\u201D cried the sailor, who did not disdain to celebrate thus\
  \ his own triumph. \u201CWith this we could go round?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe world?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, the island. Some stones for ballast, a mast and a sail, which the\
  \ captain will make for us some day, and we shall go splendidly! Well, captain?and\
  \ you, Mr. Spilett; and you, Herbert; and you, Neb?aren\u2019t you coming to try\
  \ our new vessel? Come along! we must see if it will carry all five of us!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>This was certainly a trial which ought to be made. Pencroft soon brought the
  canoe to the shore by a narrow passage among the rocks, and it was agreed that they
  should make a trial of the boat that day by following the shore as far as the first
  point at which the rocks of the south ended.</p>
- <p>As they embarked, Neb cried,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut your boat leaks rather, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat\u2019s nothing, Neb,\u201D replied the sailor; \u201Cthe wood will\
  \ get seasoned. In two days there won\u2019t be a single leak, and our boat will\
  \ have no more water in her than there is in the stomach of a drunkard. Jump in!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>They were soon all seated, and Pencroft shoved off. The weather was magnificent,
  the sea as calm as if its waters were contained within the narrow limits of a lake.
  Thus the boat could proceed with as much security as if it was ascending the tranquil
  current of the Mercy.</p>
- <p>Neb took one of the oars, Herbert the other, and Pencroft remained in the stern
  in order to use the scull.</p>
- <p>The sailor first crossed the channel, and steered close to the southern point
  of the islet. A light breeze blew from the south. No roughness was found either
  in the channel or the green sea. A long swell, which the canoe scarcely felt, as
  it was heavily laden, rolled regularly over the surface of the water. They pulled
  out about half a mile distant from the shore, that they might have a good view of
  Mount Franklin.</p>
- "<p>Pencroft afterwards returned towards the mouth of the river. The boat then skirted\
  \ the shore, which, extending to the extreme point, hid all Tadorn\u2019s Fens.</p>"
- <p>This point, of which the distance was increased by the irregularity of the coast,
  was nearly three miles from the Mercy. The settlers resolved to go to its extremity,
  and only go beyond it as much as was necessary to take a rapid survey of the coast
  as far as Claw Cape.</p>
- "<p>The canoe followed the windings of the shore, avoiding the rocks which fringed\
  \ it, and which the rising tide began to cover. The cliff gradually sloped away\
  \ from the mouth of the river to the point. This was formed of granite rocks, capriciously\
  \ distributed, very different from the cliff at Prospect Heights, and of an extremely\
  \ wild aspect. It might have been said that an immense cartload of rocks had been\
  \ emptied out there. There was no vegetation on this sharp promontory, which projected\
  \ two miles from the forest, and it thus represented a giant\u2019s arm stretched\
  \ out from a leafy sleeve.</p>"
- <p>The canoe, impelled by the two oars, advanced without difficulty. Gideon Spilett,
  pencil in one hand and notebook in the other, sketched the coast in bold strokes.
  Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft chatted, while examining this part of their domain, which
  was new to them, and, in proportion as the canoe proceeded towards the south, the
  two Mandible Capes appeared to move, and surround Union Bay more closely.</p>
- <p>As to Cyrus Harding, he did not speak; he simply gazed, and by the mistrust which
  his look expressed, it appeared that he was examining some strange country.</p>
- "<p>In the meantime, after a voyage of three\u2011quarters of an hour, the canoe\
  \ reached the extremity of the point, and Pencroft was preparing to return, when\
  \ Herbert, rising, pointed to a black object, saying,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat do I see down there on the beach?\u201D</p>"
- <p>All eyes turned towards the point indicated.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhy,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cthere is something. It looks like\
  \ part of a wreck half buried in the sand.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh!\u201D cried Pencroft, \u201CI see what it is!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat?\u201D asked Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBarrels, barrels, which perhaps are full,\u201D replied the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPull to the shore, Pencroft!\u201D said Cyrus.</p>"
- <p>A few strokes of the oar brought the canoe into a little creek, and its passengers
  leaped on shore.</p>
- <p>Pencroft was not mistaken. Two barrels were there, half buried in the sand, but
  still firmly attached to a large chest, which, sustained by them, had floated to
  the moment when it stranded on the beach.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThere has been a wreck, then, in some part of the island,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CEvidently,\u201D replied Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut what\u2019s in this chest?\u201D cried Pencroft, with very natural\
  \ impatience. \u201CWhat\u2019s in this chest? It is shut up, and nothing to open\
  \ it with! Well, perhaps a stone?\u201D</p>"
- <p>And the sailor, raising a heavy block, was about to break in one of the sides
  of the chest, when the engineer arrested his hand.</p>
- "<p>\u201CPencroft,\u201D said he, \u201Ccan you restrain your impatience for one\
  \ hour only?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, captain, just think! Perhaps there is everything we want in there!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall find that out, Pencroft,\u201D replied the engineer; \u201Cbut\
  \ trust to me, and do not break the chest, which may be useful to us. We must convey\
  \ it to Granite House, where we can open it easily, and without breaking it. It\
  \ is quite prepared for a voyage; and since it has floated here, it may just as\
  \ well float to the mouth of the river.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are right, captain, and I was wrong, as usual,\u201D replied the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>The engineer\u2019s advice was good. In fact, the canoe probably would not have\
  \ been able to contain the articles possibly enclosed in the chest, which doubtless\
  \ was heavy, since two empty barrels were required to buoy it up. It was, therefore,\
  \ much better to tow it to the beach at Granite House.</p>"
- <p>And now, whence had this chest come? That was the important question. Cyrus Harding
  and his companions looked attentively around them, and examined the shore for several
  hundred steps. No other articles or pieces of wreck could be found. Herbert and
  Neb climbed a high rock to survey the sea, but there was nothing in sight?neither
  a dismasted vessel nor a ship under sail.</p>
- <p>However, there was no doubt that there had been a wreck. Perhaps this incident
  was connected with that of the bullet? Perhaps strangers had landed on another part
  of the island? Perhaps they were still there? But the thought which came naturally
  to the settlers was, that these strangers could not be Malay pirates, for the chest
  was evidently of American or European make.</p>
- <p>All the party returned to the chest, which was of an unusually large size. It
  was made of oak wood, very carefully closed and covered with a thick hide, which
  was secured by copper nails. The two great barrels, hermetically sealed, but which
  sounded hollow and empty, were fastened to its sides by strong ropes, knotted with
  a skill which Pencroft directly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit. It appeared
  to be in a perfect state of preservation, which was explained by the fact that it
  had stranded on a sandy beach, and not among rocks. They had no doubt whatever,
  on examining it carefully, that it had not been long in the water, and that its
  arrival on this coast was recent. The water did not appear to have penetrated to
  the inside, and the articles which it contained were no doubt uninjured.</p>
- <p>It was evident that this chest had been thrown overboard from some dismasted
  vessel driven towards the island, and that, in the hope that it would reach the
  land, where they might afterwards find it, the passengers had taken the precaution
  to buoy it up by means of this floating apparatus.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe will tow this chest to Granite House,\u201D said the engineer, \u201C\
  where we can make an inventory of its contents; then, if we discover any of the\
  \ survivors from the supposed wreck, we can return it to those to whom it belongs.\
  \ If we find no one?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe will keep it for ourselves!\u201D cried Pencroft. \u201CBut what in\
  \ the world can there be in it?\u201D</p>"
- <p>The sea was already approaching the chest, and the high tide would evidently
  float it. One of the ropes which fastened the barrels was partly unlashed and used
  as a cable to unite the floating apparatus with the canoe. Pencroft and Neb then
  dug away the sand with their oars, so as to facilitate the moving of the chest,
  towing which the boat soon began to double the point, to which the name of Flotsam
  Point was given.</p>
- <p>The chest was heavy, and the barrels were scarcely sufficient to keep it above
  water. The sailor also feared every instant that it would get loose and sink to
  the bottom of the sea. But happily his fears were not realized, and an hour and
  a half after they set out?all that time had been taken up in going a distance of
  three miles?the boat touched the beach below Granite House.</p>
- <p>Canoe and chest were then hauled up on the sands; and as the tide was then going
  out, they were soon left high and dry. Neb, hurrying home, brought back some tools
  with which to open the chest in such a way that it might be injured as little as
  possible, and they proceeded to its inventory. Pencroft did not try to hide that
  he was greatly excited.</p>
- <p>The sailor began by detaching the two barrels, which, being in good condition,
  would of course be of use. Then the locks were forced with a cold chisel and hammer,
  and the lid thrown back. A second casing of zinc lined the interior of the chest,
  which had been evidently arranged that the articles which it enclosed might under
  any circumstances be sheltered from damp.</p>
- "<p>\u201COh!\u201D cried Neb, \u201Csuppose it\u2019s jam!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI hope not,\u201D replied the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf only there was?\u201D said the sailor in a low voice.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat?\u201D asked Neb, who overheard him.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNothing!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The covering of zinc was torn off and thrown back over the sides of the chest,
  and by degrees numerous articles of very varied character were produced and strewn
  about on the sand. At each new object Pencroft uttered fresh hurrahs, Herbert clapped
  his hands, and Neb danced up and down. There were books which made Herbert wild
  with joy, and cooking utensils which Neb covered with kisses!</p>
- "<p>In short, the colonists had reason to be extremely satisfied, for this chest\
  \ contained tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, books; and this is the exact list\
  \ of them as stated in Gideon Spilett\u2019s note\u2011book: ?Tools:?3 knives with\
  \ several blades, 2 woodmen\u2019s axes, 2 carpenter\u2019s hatchets, 3 planes,\
  \ 2 adzes, 1 twibil or mattock, 6 chisels, 2 files, 3 hammers, 3 gimlets, 2 augers,\
  \ 10 bags of nails and screws, 3 saws of different sizes, 2 boxes of needles.</p>"
- "<p>Weapons:?2 flint\u2011lock guns, 2 for percussion caps, 2 breach\u2011loader\
  \ carbines, 5 boarding cutlasses, 4 sabers, 2 barrels of powder, each containing\
  \ twenty\u2011five pounds; 12 boxes of percussion caps.</p>"
- "<p>Instruments:?1 sextant, 1 double opera\u2011glass, 1 telescope, 1 box of mathematical\
  \ instruments, 1 mariner\u2019s compass, 1 Fahrenheit thermometer, 1 aneroid barometer,\
  \ 1 box containing a photographic apparatus, object\u2011glass, plates, chemicals,\
  \ etc.</p>"
- <p>Clothes:?2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, but evidently
  of a vegetable origin; 3 dozen stockings of the same material.</p>
- "<p>Utensils:?1 iron pot, 6 copper saucepans, 3 iron dishes, 10 metal plates, 2\
  \ kettles, 1 portable stove, 6 table\u2011knives.</p>"
- <p>Books:?1 Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of the different Polynesian idioms, 1 dictionary
  of natural science, in six volumes; 3 reams of white paper, 2 books with blank pages.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt must be allowed,\u201D said the reporter, after the inventory had been\
  \ made, \u201Cthat the owner of this chest was a practical man! Tools, weapons,\
  \ instruments, clothes, utensils, books?nothing is wanting! It might really be said\
  \ that he expected to be wrecked, and had prepared for it beforehand.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNothing is wanting, indeed,\u201D murmured Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd for a certainty,\u201D added Herbert, \u201Cthe vessel which carried\
  \ this chest and its owner was not a Malay pirate!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CUnless,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cthe owner had been taken prisoner by\
  \ pirates?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is not admissible,\u201D replied the reporter. \u201CIt is more probable\
  \ that an American or European vessel has been driven into this quarter, and that\
  \ her passengers, wishing to save necessaries at least, prepared this chest and\
  \ threw it overboard.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIs that your opinion, captain?\u201D asked Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, my boy,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cthat may have been the\
  \ case. It is possible that at the moment, or in expectation of a wreck, they collected\
  \ into this chest different articles of the greatest use in hopes of finding it\
  \ again on the coast?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CEven the photographic box!\u201D exclaimed the sailor incredulously.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAs to that apparatus,\u201D replied Harding, \u201CI do not quite see\
  \ the use of it; and a more complete supply of clothes or more abundant ammunition\
  \ would have been more valuable to us as well as to any other castaways!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut isn\u2019t there any mark or direction on these instruments, tools,\
  \ or books, which would tell us something about them?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- <p>That might be ascertained. Each article was carefully examined, especially the
  books, instruments and weapons. Neither the weapons nor the instruments, contrary
  to the usual custom, bore the name of the maker; they were, besides, in a perfect
  state, and did not appear to have been used. The same peculiarity marked the tools
  and utensils; all were new, which proved that the articles had not been taken by
  chance and thrown into the chest, but, on the contrary, that the choice of things
  had been well considered and arranged with care. This was also indicated by the
  second case of metal which had preserved them from damp, and which could not have
  been soldered in a moment of haste.</p>
- <p>As to the dictionaries of natural science and Polynesian idioms, both were English;
  but they neither bore the name of the publisher nor the date of publication.</p>
- <p>The same with the Bible printed in English, in quarto, remarkable from a typographic
  point of view, and which appeared to have been often used.</p>
- "<p>The atlas was a magnificent work, comprising maps of every country in the world,\
  \ and several planispheres arranged upon Mercator\u2019s projection, and of which\
  \ the nomenclature was in French?but which also bore neither date nor name of publisher.</p>"
- <p>There was nothing, therefore, on these different articles by which they could
  be traced, and nothing consequently of a nature to show the nationality of the vessel
  which must have recently passed these shores.</p>
- <p>But, wherever the chest might have come from, it was a treasure to the settlers
  on Lincoln Island. Till then, by making use of the productions of nature, they had
  created everything for themselves, and, thanks to their intelligence, they had managed
  without difficulty. But did it not appear as if Providence had wished to reward
  them by sending them these productions of human industry? Their thanks rose unanimously
  to Heaven.</p>
- "<p>However, one of them was not quite satisfied: it was Pencroft. It appeared that\
  \ the chest did not contain something which he evidently held in great esteem, for\
  \ in proportion as they approached the bottom of the box, his hurrahs diminished\
  \ in heartiness, and, the inventory finished, he was heard to mutter these words:?\u201C\
  That\u2019s all very fine, but you can see that there is nothing for me in that\
  \ box!\u201D</p>"
- <p>This led Neb to say,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhy, friend Pencroft, what more do you expect?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHalf a pound of tobacco,\u201D replied Pencroft seriously, \u201Cand nothing\
  \ would have been wanting to complete my happiness!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>No one could help laughing at this speech of the sailor\u2019s.</p>"
- <p>But the result of this discovery of the chest was, that it was now more than
  ever necessary to explore the island thoroughly. It was therefore agreed that the
  next morning at break of day, they should set out, by ascending the Mercy so as
  to reach the western shore. If any castaways had landed on the coast, it was to
  be feared they were without resources, and it was therefore the more necessary to
  carry help to them without delay.</p>
- <p>During the day the different articles were carried to Granite House, where they
  were methodically arranged in the great hall. This day?the 29th of October?happened
  to be a Sunday, and, before going to bed, Herbert asked the engineer if he would
  not read them something from the Gospel.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWillingly,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>He took the sacred volume, and was about to open it, when Pencroft stopped him,\
  \ saying,?\u201CCaptain, I am superstitious. Open at random and read the first verse\
  \ which, your eye falls upon. We will see if it applies to our situation.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding smiled at the sailor\u2019s idea, and, yielding to his wish, he\
  \ opened exactly at a place where the leaves were separated by a marker.</p>"
- <p>Immediately his eyes were attracted by a cross which, made with a pencil, was
  placed against the eighth verse of the seventh chapter of the Gospel of St. Matthew.
  He read the verse, which was this:?</p>
- "<p>\u201CFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Chapter 3</p>
- <p>The next day, the 30th of October, all was ready for the proposed exploring expedition,
  which recent events had rendered so necessary. In fact, things had so come about
  that the settlers in Lincoln Island no longer needed help for themselves, but were
  even able to carry it to others.</p>
- <p>It was therefore agreed that they should ascend the Mercy as far as the river
  was navigable. A great part of the distance would thus be traversed without fatigue,
  and the explorers could transport their provisions and arms to an advanced point
  in the west of the island.</p>
- "<p>It was necessary to think not only of the things which they should take with\
  \ them, but also of those which they might have by chance to bring back to Granite\
  \ House. If there had been a wreck on the coast, as was supposed, there would be\
  \ many things cast up, which would be lawfully their prizes. In the event of this,\
  \ the cart would have been of more use than the light canoe, but it was heavy and\
  \ clumsy to drag, and therefore more difficult to use; this led Pencroft to express\
  \ his regret that the chest had not contained, besides \u201Chis halfpound of tobacco,\u201D\
  \ a pair of strong New Jersey horses, which would have been very useful to the colony!</p>"
- <p>The provisions, which Neb had already packed up, consisted of a store of meat
  and of several gallons of beer, that is to say enough to sustain them for three
  days, the time which Harding assigned for the expedition. They hoped besides to
  supply themselves on the road, and Neb took care not to forget the portable stove.</p>
- "<p>The only tools the settlers took were the two woodmen\u2019s axes, which they\
  \ could use to cut a path through the thick forests, as also the instruments, the\
  \ telescope and pocket\u2011compass.</p>"
- "<p>For weapons they selected the two flint\u2011lock guns, which were likely to\
  \ be more useful to them than the percussion fowling\u2011pieces, the first only\
  \ requiring flints which could be easily replaced, and the latter needing fulminating\
  \ caps, a frequent use of which would soon exhaust their limited stock. However,\
  \ they took also one of the carbines and some cartridges. As to the powder, of which\
  \ there was about fifty pounds in the barrel, a small supply of it had to be taken,\
  \ but the engineer hoped to manufacture an explosive substance which would allow\
  \ them to husband it. To the firearms were added the five cutlasses well sheathed\
  \ in leather, and, thus supplied, the settlers could venture into the vast forest\
  \ with some chance of success.</p>"
- <p>It is useless to add that Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb, thus armed, were at the
  summit of their happiness, although Cyrus Harding made them promise not to fire
  a shot unless it was necessary.</p>
- <p>At six in the morning the canoe put off from the shore; all had embarked, including
  Top, and they proceeded to the mouth of the Mercy.</p>
- <p>The tide had begun to come up half an hour before. For several hours, therefore,
  there would be a current, which it was well to profit by, for later the ebb would
  make it difficult to ascend the river. The tide was already strong, for in three
  days the moon would be full, and it was enough to keep the boat in the center of
  the current, where it floated swiftly along between the high banks without its being
  necessary to increase its speed by the aid of the oars. In a few minutes the explorers
  arrived at the angle formed by the Mercy and exactly at the place where, seven months
  before, Pencroft had made his first raft of wood.</p>
- <p>After this sudden angle the river widened and flowed under the shade of great
  evergreen firs.</p>
- <p>The aspect of the banks was magnificent. Cyrus Harding and his companions could
  not but admire the lovely effects so easily produced by nature with water and trees.
  As they advanced the forest element diminished. On the right bank of the river grew
  magnificent specimens of the ulmaceae tribe, the precious elm, so valuable to builders,
  and which withstands well the action of water. Then there were numerous groups belonging
  to the same family, among others one in particular, the fruit of which produces
  a very useful oil. Further on, Herbert remarked the lardizabala, a twining shrub
  which, when bruised in water, furnishes excellent cordage; and two or three ebony
  trees of a beautiful black, crossed with capricious veins.</p>
- <p>From time to time, in certain places where the landing was easy, the canoe was
  stopped, when Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft, their guns in their hands,
  and preceded by Top, jumped on shore. Without expecting game, some useful plant
  might be met with, and the young naturalist was delighted with discovering a sort
  of wild spinach, belonging to the order of chenopodiaceae, and numerous specimens
  of cruciferae, belonging to the cabbage tribe, which it would certainly be possible
  to cultivate by transplanting. There were cresses, horseradish, turnips, and lastly,
  little branching hairy stalks, scarcely more than three feet high, which produced
  brownish grains.</p>
- "<p>\u201CDo you know what this plant is?\u201D asked Herbert of the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTobacco!\u201D cried Pencroft, who evidently had never seen his favorite\
  \ plant except in the bowl of his pipe.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Pencroft,\u201D replied Herbert; \u201Cthis is not tobacco, it is\
  \ mustard.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMustard be hanged!\u201D returned the sailor; \u201Cbut if by chance you\
  \ happen to come across a tobacco\u2011plant, my boy, pray don\u2019t scorn that!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall find it some day!\u201D said Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201Cwhen that day comes, I do not know\
  \ what more will be wanting in our island!\u201D</p>"
- <p>These different plants, which had been carefully rooted up, were carried to the
  canoe, where Cyrus Harding had remained buried in thought.</p>
- <p>The reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft in this manner frequently disembarked, sometimes
  on the right bank, sometimes on the left bank of the Mercy.</p>
- "<p>The latter was less abrupt, but the former more wooded. The engineer ascertained\
  \ by consulting his pocket\u2011compass that the direction of the river from the\
  \ first turn was obviously southwest and northeast, and nearly straight for a length\
  \ of about three miles. But it was to be supposed that this direction changed beyond\
  \ that point, and that the Mercy continued to the north\u2011west, towards the spurs\
  \ of Mount Franklin, among which the river rose.</p>"
- "<p>During one of these excursions, Gideon Spilett managed to get hold of two couples\
  \ of living gallinaceae. They were birds with long, thin beaks, lengthened necks,\
  \ short wings, and without any appearance of a tail. Herbert rightly gave them the\
  \ name of tinamous, and it was resolved that they should be the first tenants of\
  \ their future poultry\u2011yard.</p>"
- <p>But till then the guns had not spoken, and the first report which awoke the echoes
  of the forest of the Far West was provoked by the appearance of a beautiful bird,
  resembling the kingfisher.</p>
- "<p>\u201CI recognize him!\u201D cried Pencroft, and it seemed as if his gun went\
  \ off by itself.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat do you recognize?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe bird which escaped us on our first excursion, and from which we gave\
  \ the name to that part of the forest.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA jacamar!\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>It was indeed a jacamar, of which the plumage shines with a metallic luster.\
  \ A shot brought it to the ground, and Top carried it to the canoe. At the same\
  \ time half a dozen lories were brought down. The lory is of the size of a pigeon,\
  \ the plumage dashed with green, part of the wings crimson, and its crest bordered\
  \ with white. To the young boy belonged the honor of this shot, and he was proud\
  \ enough of it. Lories are better food than the jacamar, the flesh of which is rather\
  \ tough, but it was difficult to persuade Pencroft that he had not killed the king\
  \ of eatable birds. It was ten o\u2019clock in the morning when the canoe reached\
  \ a second angle of the Mercy, nearly five miles from its mouth. Here a halt was\
  \ made for breakfast under the shade of some splendid trees. The river still measured\
  \ from sixty to seventy feet in breadth, and its bed from five to six feet in depth.\
  \ The engineer had observed that it was increased by numerous affluents, but they\
  \ were unnavigable, being simply little streams. As to the forest, including Jacamar\
  \ Wood, as well as the forests of the Far West, it extended as far as the eye could\
  \ reach. In no place, either in the depths of the forests or under the trees on\
  \ the banks of the Mercy, was the presence of man revealed. The explorers could\
  \ not discover one suspicious trace. It was evident that the woodman\u2019s axe\
  \ had never touched these trees, that the pioneer\u2019s knife had never severed\
  \ the creepers hanging from one trunk to another in the midst of tangled brushwood\
  \ and long grass. If castaways had landed on the island, they could not have yet\
  \ quitted the shore, and it was not in the woods that the survivors of the supposed\
  \ shipwreck should be sought.</p>"
- <p>The engineer therefore manifested some impatience to reach the western coast
  of Lincoln Island, which was at least five miles distant according to his estimation.</p>
- <p>The voyage was continued, and as the Mercy appeared to flow not towards the shore,
  but rather towards Mount Franklin, it was decided that they should use the boat
  as long as there was enough water under its keel to float it. It was both fatigue
  spared and time gained, for they would have been obliged to cut a path through the
  thick wood with their axes. But soon the flow completely failed them, either the
  tide was going down, and it was about the hour, or it could no longer be felt at
  this distance from the mouth of the Mercy. They had therefore to make use of the
  oars. Herbert and Neb each took one, and Pencroft took the scull. The forest soon
  became less dense, the trees grew further apart and often quite isolated. But the
  further they were from each other the more magnificent they appeared, profiting,
  as they did, by the free, pure air which circulated around them.</p>
- <p>What splendid specimens of the flora of this latitude! Certainly their presence
  would have been enough for a botanist to name without hesitation the parallel which
  traversed Lincoln Island.</p>
- "<p>\u201CEucalypti!\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>They were, in fact, those splendid trees, the giants of the extratropical zone,\
  \ the congeners of the Australian and New Zealand eucalyptus, both situated under\
  \ the same latitude as Lincoln Island. Some rose to a height of two hundred feet.\
  \ Their trunks at the base measured twenty feet in circumference, and their bark\
  \ was covered by a network of farrows containing a red, sweet\u2011smelling gum.\
  \ Nothing is more wonderful or more singular than those enormous specimens of the\
  \ order of the myrtaceae, with their leaves placed vertically and not horizontally,\
  \ so that an edge and not a surface looks upwards, the effect being that the sun\u2019\
  s rays penetrate more freely among the trees.</p>"
- <p>The ground at the foot of the eucalypti was carpeted with grass, and from the
  bushes escaped flights of little birds, which glittered in the sunlight like winged
  rubies.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThese are something like trees!\u201D cried Neb; \u201Cbut are they good\
  \ for anything?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPooh!\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201COf course there are vegetable giants\
  \ as well as human giants, and they are no good, except to show themselves at fairs!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CI think that you are mistaken, Pencroft,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett,\
  \ \u201Cand that the wood of the eucalyptus has begun to be very advantageously\
  \ employed in cabinet\u2011making.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd I may add,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cthat the eucalyptus belongs to\
  \ a family which comprises many useful members; the guava\u2011tree, from whose\
  \ fruit guava jelly is made; the clove\u2011tree, which produces the spice; the\
  \ pomegranate\u2011tree, which bears pomegranates; the Eugeacia Cauliflora, the\
  \ fruit of which is used in making a tolerable wine; the Ugui myrtle, which contains\
  \ an excellent alcoholic liquor; the Caryophyllus myrtle, of which the bark forms\
  \ an esteemed cinnamon; the Eugenia Pimenta, from whence comes Jamaica pepper; the\
  \ common myrtle, from whose buds and berries spice is sometimes made; the Eucalyptus\
  \ manifera, which yields a sweet sort of manna; the Guinea Eucalyptus, the sap of\
  \ which is transformed into beer by fermentation; in short, all those trees known\
  \ under the name of gum\u2011trees or iron\u2011bark trees in Australia, belong\
  \ to this family of the myrtaceae, which contains forty\u2011six genera and thirteen\
  \ hundred species!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The lad was allowed to run on, and he delivered his little botanical lecture
  with great animation. Cyrus Harding listened smiling, and Pencroft with an indescribable
  feeling of pride.</p>
- "<p>\u201CVery good, Herbert,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cbut I could swear that\
  \ all those useful specimens you have just told us about are none of them giants\
  \ like these!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is true, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat supports what I said,\u201D returned the sailor, \u201Cnamely, that\
  \ these giants are good for nothing!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere you are wrong, Pencroft,\u201D said the engineer; \u201Cthese gigantic\
  \ eucalypti, which shelter us, are good for something.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd what is that?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo render the countries which they inhabit healthy. Do you know what they\
  \ are called in Australia and New Zealand?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, captain.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey are called ?fever trees.\u201C</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBecause they give fevers?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, because they prevent them!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGood. I must note that,\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNote it then, my dear Spilett; for it appears proved that the presence\
  \ of the eucalyptus is enough to neutralize miasmas. This natural antidote has been\
  \ tried in certain countries in the middle of Europe and the north of Africa where\
  \ the soil was absolutely unhealthy, and the sanitary condition of the inhabitants\
  \ has been gradually ameliorated. No more intermittent fevers prevail in the regions\
  \ now covered with forests of the myrtaceae. This fact is now beyond doubt, and\
  \ it is a happy circumstance for us settlers in Lincoln Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh! what an island! What a blessed island!\u201D cried Pencroft. \u201C\
  I tell you, it wants nothing?unless it is?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat will come, Pencroft, that will be found,\u201D replied the engineer;\
  \ \u201Cbut now we must continue our voyage and push on as far as the river will\
  \ carry our boat!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The exploration was therefore continued for another two miles in the midst of
  country covered with eucalypti, which predominated in the woods of this portion
  of the island. The space which they occupied extended as far as the eye could reach
  on each side of the Mercy, which wound along between high green banks. The bed was
  often obstructed by long weeds, and even by pointed rocks, which rendered the navigation
  very difficult. The action of the oars was prevented, and Pencroft was obliged to
  push with a pole. They found also that the water was becoming shallower and shallower,
  and that the canoe must soon stop. The sun was already sinking towards the horizon,
  and the trees threw long shadows on the ground. Cyrus Harding, seeing that he could
  not hope to reach the western coast of the island in one journey, resolved to camp
  at the place where any further navigation was prevented by want of water. He calculated
  that they were still five or six miles from the coast, and this distance was too
  great for them to attempt during the night in the midst of unknown woods.</p>
- "<p>The boat was pushed on through the forest, which gradually became thicker again,\
  \ and appeared also to have more inhabitants; for if the eyes of the sailor did\
  \ not deceive him, he thought he saw bands of monkeys springing among the trees.\
  \ Sometimes even two or three of these animals stopped at a little distance from\
  \ the canoe and gazed at the settlers without manifesting any terror, as if, seeing\
  \ men for the first time, they had not yet learned to fear them. It would have been\
  \ easy to bring down one of these quadramani with a gunshot, and Pencroft was greatly\
  \ tempted to fire, but Harding opposed so useless a massacre. This was prudent,\
  \ for the monkeys, or apes rather, appearing to be very powerful and extremely active,\
  \ it was useless to provoke an unnecessary aggression, and the creatures might,\
  \ ignorant of the power of the explorers\u2019 firearms, have attacked them. It\
  \ is true that the sailor considered the monkeys from a purely alimentary point\
  \ of view, for those animals which are herbivorous make very excellent game; but\
  \ since they had an abundant supply of provisions, it was a pity to waste their\
  \ ammunition.</p>"
- "<p>Towards four o\u2019clock, the navigation of the Mercy became exceedingly difficult,\
  \ for its course was obstructed by aquatic plants and rocks. The banks rose higher\
  \ and higher, and already they were approaching the spurs of Mount Franklin. The\
  \ source could not be far off, since it was fed by the water from the southern slopes\
  \ of the mountain.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn a quarter of an hour,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cwe shall be obliged\
  \ to stop, captain.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery well, we will stop, Pencroft, and we will make our encampment for\
  \ the night.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt what distance are we from Granite House?\u201D asked Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAbout seven miles,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Ctaking into calculation,\
  \ however, the detours of the river, which has carried us to the northwest.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CShall we go on?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, as long as we can,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding. \u201CTo\u2011morrow,\
  \ at break of day, we will leave the canoe, and in two hours I hope we shall cross\
  \ the distance which separates us from the coast, and then we shall have the whole\
  \ day in which to explore the shore.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGo ahead!\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>But soon the boat grated on the stony bottom of the river, which was now not\
  \ more than twenty feet in breadth. The trees met like a bower overhead, and caused\
  \ a half\u2011darkness. They also heard the noise of a waterfall, which showed that\
  \ a few hundred feet up the river there was a natural barrier.</p>"
- <p>Presently, after a sudden turn of the river, a cascade appeared through the trees.
  The canoe again touched the bottom, and in a few minutes it was moored to a trunk
  near the right bank.</p>
- "<p>It was nearly five o\u2019clock. The last rays of the sun gleamed through the\
  \ thick foliage and glanced on the little waterfall, making the spray sparkle with\
  \ all the colors of the rainbow. Beyond that, the Mercy was lost in the bushwood,\
  \ where it was fed from some hidden source. The different streams which flowed into\
  \ it increased it to a regular river further down, but here it was simply a shallow,\
  \ limpid brook.</p>"
- <p>It was agreed to camp here, as the place was charming. The colonists disembarked,
  and a fire was soon lighted under a clump of trees, among the branches of which
  Cyrus Harding and his companions could, if it was necessary, take refuge for the
  night.</p>
- "<p>Supper was quickly devoured, for they were very hungry, and then there was only\
  \ sleeping to think of. But, as roarings of rather a suspicious nature had been\
  \ heard during the evening, a good fire was made up for the night, so as to protect\
  \ the sleepers with its crackling flames. Neb and Pencroft also watched by turns,\
  \ and did not spare fuel. They thought they saw the dark forms of some wild animals\
  \ prowling round the camp among the bushes, but the night passed without incident,\
  \ and the next day, the 31st of October, at five o\u2019clock in the morning, all\
  \ were on foot, ready for a start.</p>"
- <p>Chapter 4</p>
- "<p>It was six o\u2019 clock in the morning when the settlers, after a hasty breakfast,\
  \ set out to reach by the shortest way, the western coast of the island. And how\
  \ long would it take to do this? Cyrus Harding had said two hours, but of course\
  \ that depended on the nature of the obstacles they might meet with. As it was probable\
  \ that they would have to cut a path through the grass, shrubs, and creepers, they\
  \ marched axe in hand, and with guns also ready, wisely taking warning from the\
  \ cries of the wild beasts heard in the night.</p>"
- "<p>The exact position of the encampment could be determined by the bearing of Mount\
  \ Franklin, and as the volcano arose in the north at a distance of less than three\
  \ miles, they had only to go straight towards the southwest to reach the western\
  \ coast. They set out, having first carefully secured the canoe. Pencroft and Neb\
  \ carried sufficient provision for the little band for at least two days. It would\
  \ not thus be necessary to hunt. The engineer advised his companions to refrain\
  \ from firing, that their presence might not be betrayed to any one near the shore.\
  \ The first hatchet blows were given among the brushwood in the midst of some mastic\u2011\
  trees, a little above the cascade; and his compass in his hand, Cyrus Harding led\
  \ the way.</p>"
- <p>The forest here was composed for the most part of trees which had already been
  met with near the lake and on Prospect Heights. There were deodars, Douglas firs,
  casuarinas, gum trees, eucalypti, hibiscus, cedars, and other trees, generally of
  a moderate size, for their number prevented their growth.</p>
- <p>Since their departure, the settlers had descended the slopes which constituted
  the mountain system of the island, on to a dry soil, but the luxuriant vegetation
  of which indicated it to be watered either by some subterranean marsh or by some
  stream. However, Cyrus Harding did not remember having seen, at the time of his
  excursion to the crater, any other watercourses but the Red Creek and the Mercy.</p>
- <p>During the first part of their excursion, they saw numerous troops of monkeys
  who exhibited great astonishment at the sight of men, whose appearance was so new
  to them. Gideon Spilett jokingly asked whether these active and merry quadrupeds
  did not consider him and his companions as degenerate brothers.</p>
- <p>And certainly, pedestrians, hindered at each step by bushes, caught by creepers,
  barred by trunks of trees, did not shine beside those supple animals, who, bounding
  from branch to branch, were hindered by nothing on their course. The monkeys were
  numerous, but happily they did not manifest any hostile disposition.</p>
- <p>Several pigs, agoutis, kangaroos, and other rodents were seen, also two or three
  koalas, at which Pencroft longed to have a shot.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D said he, \u201Cyou may jump and play just now; we shall have\
  \ one or two words to say to you on our way back!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>At half\u2011past nine the way was suddenly found to be barred by an unknown\
  \ stream, from thirty to forty feet broad, whose rapid current dashed foaming over\
  \ the numerous rocks which interrupted its course. This creek was deep and clear,\
  \ but it was absolutely unnavigable.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe are cut off!\u201D cried Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Herbert, \u201Cit is only a stream, and we can easily\
  \ swim over.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat would be the use of that?\u201D returned Harding. \u201CThis creek\
  \ evidently runs to the sea. Let us remain on this side and follow the bank, and\
  \ I shall be much astonished if it does not lead us very quickly to the coast. Forward!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201COne minute,\u201D said the reporter. \u201CThe name of this creek, my\
  \ friends? Do not let us leave our geography incomplete.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAll right!\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CName it, my boy,\u201D said the engineer, addressing the lad.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWill it not be better to wait until we have explored it to its mouth?\u201D\
  \ answered Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery well,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding. \u201CLet us follow it as fast\
  \ as we can without stopping.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CStill another minute!\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThough hunting is forbidden, fishing is allowed, I suppose,\u201D said\
  \ the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe have no time to lose,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh! five minutes!\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201CI only ask for five minutes\
  \ to use in the interest of our breakfast!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And Pencroft, lying down on the bank, plunged his arm into the water, and soon
  pulled up several dozen of fine crayfish from among the stones.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThese will be good!\u201D cried Neb, going to the sailor\u2019s aid.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAs I said, there is everything in this island, except tobacco!\u201D muttered\
  \ Pencroft with a sigh.</p>"
- <p>The fishing did not take five minutes, for the crayfish were swarming in the
  creek. A bag was filled with the crustaceae, whose shells were of a cobalt blue.
  The settlers then pushed on.</p>
- <p>They advanced more rapidly and easily along the bank of the river than in the
  forest. From time to time they came upon the traces of animals of a large size who
  had come to quench their thirst at the stream, but none were actually seen, and
  it was evidently not in this part of the forest that the peccary had received the
  bullet which had cost Pencroft a grinder.</p>
- <p>In the meanwhile, considering the rapid current, Harding was led to suppose that
  he and his companions were much farther from the western coast than they had at
  first supposed. In fact, at this hour, the rising tide would have turned back the
  current of the creek, if its mouth had only been a few miles distant. Now, this
  effect was not produced, and the water pursued its natural course. The engineer
  was much astonished at this, and frequently consulted his compass, to assure himself
  that some turn of the river was not leading them again into the Far West.</p>
- <p>However, the creek gradually widened and its waters became less tumultuous. The
  trees on the right bank were as close together as on the left bank, and it was impossible
  to distinguish anything beyond them; but these masses of wood were evidently uninhabited,
  for Top did not bark, and the intelligent animal would not have failed to signal
  the presence of any stranger in the neighborhood.</p>
- "<p>At half\u2011past ten, to the great surprise of Cyrus Harding, Herbert, who\
  \ was a little in front, suddenly stopped and exclaimed,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe sea!\u201D</p>"
- <p>In a few minutes more, the whole western shore of the island lay extended before
  the eyes of the settlers.</p>
- <p>But what a contrast between this and the eastern coast, upon which chance had
  first thrown them. No granite cliff, no rocks, not even a sandy beach. The forest
  reached the shore, and the tall trees bending over the water were beaten by the
  waves. It was not such a shore as is usually formed by nature, either by extending
  a vast carpet of sand, or by grouping masses of rock, but a beautiful border consisting
  of the most splendid trees. The bank was raised a little above the level of the
  sea, and on this luxuriant soil, supported by a granite base, the fine forest trees
  seemed to be as firmly planted as in the interior of the island.</p>
- "<p>The colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor, which\
  \ would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing\u2011boats. It served\
  \ as a neck to the new creek, of which the curious thing was that its waters, instead\
  \ of joining the sea by a gentle slope, fell from a height of more than forty feet,\
  \ which explained why the rising tide was not felt up the stream. In fact, the tides\
  \ of the Pacific, even at their maximum elevation, could never reach the level of\
  \ the river, and, doubtless, millions of years would pass before the water would\
  \ have worn away the granite and hollowed a practicable mouth.</p>"
- "<p>It was settled that the name of Falls River should be given to this stream.\
  \ Beyond, towards the north, the forest border was prolonged for a space of nearly\
  \ two miles; then the trees became scarcer, and beyond that again the picturesque\
  \ heights described a nearly straight line, which ran north and south. On the contrary,\
  \ all the part of the shore between Falls River and Reptile End was a mass of wood,\
  \ magnificent trees, some straight, others bent, so that the long sea\u2011swell\
  \ bathed their roots. Now, it was this coast, that is, all the Serpentine Peninsula,\
  \ that was to be explored, for this part of the shore offered a refuge to castaways,\
  \ which the other wild and barren side must have refused.</p>"
- <p>The weather was fine and clear, and from a height of a hillock on which Neb and
  Pencroft had arranged breakfast, a wide view was obtained. There was, however, not
  a sail in sight; nothing could be seen along the shore as far as the eye could reach.
  But the engineer would take nothing for granted until he had explored the coast
  to the very extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula.</p>
- "<p>Breakfast was soon despatched, and at half\u2011past eleven the captain gave\
  \ the signal for departure. Instead of proceeding over the summit of a cliff or\
  \ along a sandy beach, the settlers were obliged to remain under cover of the trees\
  \ so that they might continue on the shore.</p>"
- <p>The distance which separated Falls River from Reptile End was about twelve miles.
  It would have taken the settlers four hours to do this, on a clear ground and without
  hurrying themselves; but as it was they needed double the time, for what with trees
  to go round, bushes to cut down, and creepers to chop away, they were impeded at
  every step, these obstacles greatly lengthening their journey.</p>
- <p>There was, however, nothing to show that a shipwreck had taken place recently.
  It is true that, as Gideon Spilett observed, any remains of it might have drifted
  out to sea, and they must not take it for granted that because they could find no
  traces of it, a ship had not been castaway on the coast.</p>
- "<p>The reporter\u2019s argument was just, and besides, the incident of the bullet\
  \ proved that a shot must have been fired in Lincoln Island within three months.</p>"
- "<p>It was already five o\u2019clock, and there were still two miles between the\
  \ settlers and the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula. It was evident that after\
  \ having reached Reptile End, Harding and his companions would not have time to\
  \ return before dark to their encampment near the source of the Mercy. It would\
  \ therefore be necessary to pass the night on the promontory. But they had no lack\
  \ of provisions, which was lucky, for there were no animals on the shore, though\
  \ birds, on the contrary, abound?jacamars, couroucous, tragopans, grouse, lories,\
  \ parrots, cockatoos, pheasants, pigeons, and a hundred others. There was not a\
  \ tree without a nest, and not a nest which was not full of flapping wings.</p>"
- "<p>Towards seven o\u2019clock the weary explorers arrived at Reptile End. Here\
  \ the seaside forest ended, and the shore resumed the customary appearance of a\
  \ coast, with rocks, reefs, and sands. It was possible that something might be found\
  \ here, but darkness came on, and the further exploration had to be put off to the\
  \ next day.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft and Herbert hastened on to find a suitable place for their camp. Among
  the last trees of the forest of the Far West, the boy found several thick clumps
  of bamboos.</p>
- "<p>\u201CGood,\u201D said he; \u201Cthis is a valuable discovery.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CValuable?\u201D returned Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCertainly,\u201D replied Herbert. \u201CI may say, Pencroft, that the\
  \ bark of the bamboo, cut into flexible laths, is used for making baskets; that\
  \ this bark, mashed into a paste, is used for the manufacture of Chinese paper;\
  \ that the stalks furnish, according to their size, canes and pipes and are used\
  \ for conducting water; that large bamboos make excellent material for building,\
  \ being light and strong, and being never attacked by insects. I will add that by\
  \ sawing the bamboo in two at the joint, keeping for the bottom the part of the\
  \ transverse film which forms the joint, useful cups are obtained, which are much\
  \ in use among the Chinese. No! you don\u2019t care for that. But?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut what?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut I can tell you, if you are ignorant of it, that in India these bamboos\
  \ are eaten like asparagus.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAsparagus thirty feet high!\u201D exclaimed the sailor. \u201CAnd are\
  \ they good?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CExcellent,\u201D replied Herbert. \u201COnly it is not the stems of thirty\
  \ feet high which are eaten, but the young shoots.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerfect, my boy, perfect!\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI will also add that the pith of the young stalks, preserved in vinegar,\
  \ makes a good pickle.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBetter and better, Herbert!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd lastly, that the bamboos exude a sweet liquor which can be made into\
  \ a very agreeable drink.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIs that all?\u201D asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is all!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd they don\u2019t happen to do for smoking?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, my poor Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Herbert and the sailor had not to look long for a place in which to pass the
  night. The rocks, which must have been violently beaten by the sea under the influence
  of the winds of the southwest, presented many cavities in which shelter could be
  found against the night air. But just as they were about to enter one of these caves
  a loud roaring arrested them.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBack!\u201D cried Pencroft. \u201COur guns are only loaded with small\
  \ shot, and beasts which can roar as loud as that would care no more for it than\
  \ for grains of salt!\u201D And the sailor, seizing Herbert by the arm, dragged\
  \ him behind a rock, just as a magnificent animal showed itself at the entrance\
  \ of the cavern.</p>"
- <p>It was a jaguar of a size at least equal to its Asiatic congeners, that is to
  say, it measured five feet from the extremity of its head to the beginning of its
  tail. The yellow color of its hair was relieved by streaks and regular oblong spots
  of black, which contrasted with the white of its chest. Herbert recognized it as
  the ferocious rival of the tiger, as formidable as the puma, which is the rival
  of the largest wolf!</p>
- <p>The jaguar advanced and gazed around him with blazing eyes, his hair bristling
  as if this was not the first time he had scented men.</p>
- <p>At this moment the reporter appeared round a rock, and Herbert, thinking that
  he had not seen the jaguar, was about to rush towards him, when Gideon Spilett signed
  to him to remain where he was. This was not his first tiger, and advancing to within
  ten feet of the animal he remained motionless, his gun to his shoulder, without
  moving a muscle. The jaguar collected itself for a spring, but at that moment a
  shot struck it in the eyes, and it fell dead.</p>
- <p>Herbert and Pencroft rushed towards the jaguar. Neb and Harding also ran up,
  and they remained for some instants contemplating the animal as it lay stretched
  on the ground, thinking that its magnificent skin would be a great ornament to the
  hall at Granite House.</p>
- "<p>\u201COh, Mr. Spilett, how I admire and envy you!\u201D cried Herbert, in a\
  \ fit of very natural enthusiasm.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, my boy,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Cyou could have done the\
  \ same.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI! with such coolness!?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CImagine to yourself, Herbert, that the jaguar is only a hare, and you\
  \ would fire as quietly as possible.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is,\u201D rejoined Pencroft, \u201Cthat it is not more dangerous\
  \ than a hare!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd now,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Csince the jaguar has left its\
  \ abode, I do not see, my friends, why we should not take possession of it for the\
  \ night.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut others may come,\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt will be enough to light a fire at the entrance of the cavern,\u201D\
  \ said the reporter, \u201Cand no wild beasts will dare to cross the threshold.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CInto the jaguar\u2019s house, then!\u201D replied the sailor, dragging\
  \ after him the body of the animal.</p>"
- <p>While Neb skinned the jaguar, his companions collected an abundant supply of
  dry wood from the forest, which they heaped up at the cave.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding, seeing the clump of bamboos, cut a quantity, which he mingled
  with the other fuel.</p>
- <p>This done, they entered the grotto, of which the floor was strewn with bones,
  the guns were carefully loaded, in case of a sudden attack, they had supper, and
  then just before they lay down to rest, the heap of wood piled at the entrance was
  set fire to. Immediately, a regular explosion, or rather a series of reports, broke
  the silence! The noise was caused by the bamboos, which, as the flames reached them,
  exploded like fireworks. The noise was enough to terrify even the boldest of wild
  beasts.</p>
- <p>It was not the engineer who had invented this way of causing loud explosions,
  for, according to Marco Polo, the Tartars have employed it for many centuries to
  drive away from their encampments the formidable wild beasts of Central Asia.</p>
- <p>Chapter 5</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions slept like innocent marmots in the cave which
  the jaguar had so politely left at their disposal.</p>
- "<p>At sunrise all were on the shore at the extremity of the promontory, and their\
  \ gaze was directed towards the horizon, of which two\u2011thirds of the circumference\
  \ were visible. For the last time the engineer could ascertain that not a sail nor\
  \ the wreck of a ship was on the sea, and even with the telescope nothing suspicious\
  \ could be discovered.</p>"
- <p>There was nothing either on the shore, at least, in the straight line of three
  miles which formed the south side of the promontory, for beyond that, rising ground
  had the rest of the coast, and even from the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula
  Claw Cape could not be seen.</p>
- <p>The southern coast of the island still remained to be explored. Now should they
  undertake it immediately, and devote this day to it?</p>
- <p>This was not included in their first plan. In fact, when the boat was abandoned
  at the sources of the Mercy, it had been agreed that after having surveyed the west
  coast, they should go back to it, and return to Granite House by the Mercy. Harding
  then thought that the western coast would have offered refuge, either to a ship
  in distress, or to a vessel in her regular course; but now, as he saw that this
  coast presented no good anchorage, he wished to seek on the south what they had
  not been able to find on the west.</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett proposed to continue the exploration, that the question of the
  supposed wreck might be completely settled, and he asked at what distance Claw Cape
  might be from the extremity of the peninsula.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAbout thirty miles,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cif we take into\
  \ consideration the curvings of the coast.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThirty miles!\u201D returned Spilett. \u201CThat would be a long day\u2019\
  s march. Nevertheless, I think that we should return to Granite House by the south\
  \ coast.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D observed Herbert, \u201Cfrom Claw Cape to Granite House there\
  \ must be at least another ten miles.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMake it forty miles in all,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cand do not\
  \ hesitate to do it. At least we should survey the unknown shore, and then we shall\
  \ not have to begin the exploration again.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery good,\u201D said Pencroft. \u201CBut the boat?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe boat has remained by itself for one day at the sources of the Mercy,\u201D\
  \ replied Gideon Spilett; \u201Cit may just as well stay there two days! As yet,\
  \ we have had no reason to think that the island is infested by thieves!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYet,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cwhen I remember the history of the turtle,\
  \ I am far from confident of that.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe turtle! the turtle!\u201D replied the reporter. \u201CDon\u2019t you\
  \ know that the sea turned it over?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho knows?\u201D murmured the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut,?\u201D said Neb.</p>"
- <p>Neb had evidently something to say, for he opened his mouth to speak and yet
  said nothing.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat do you want to say, Neb?\u201D asked the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf we return by the shore to Claw Cape,\u201D replied Neb, \u201Cafter\
  \ having doubled the Cape, we shall be stopped?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBy the Mercy! of course,\u201D replied Herbert, \u201Cand we shall have\
  \ neither bridge nor boat by which to cross.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, captain,\u201D added Pencroft, \u201Cwith a few floating trunks we\
  \ shall have no difficulty in crossing the river.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNever mind,\u201D said Spilett, \u201Cit will be useful to construct a\
  \ bridge if we wish to have an easy access to the Far West!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA bridge!\u201D cried Pencroft. \u201CWell, is not the captain the best\
  \ engineer in his profession? He will make us a bridge when we want one. As to transporting\
  \ you this evening to the other side of the Mercy, and that without wetting one\
  \ thread of your clothes, I will take care of that. We have provisions for another\
  \ day, and besides we can get plenty of game. Forward!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The reporter\u2019s proposal, so strongly seconded by the sailor, received general\
  \ approbation, for each wished to have their doubts set at rest, and by returning\
  \ by Claw Cape the exploration would be ended. But there was not an hour to lose,\
  \ for forty miles was a long march, and they could not hope to reach Granite House\
  \ before night.</p>"
- "<p>At six o\u2019clock in the morning the little band set out. As a precaution\
  \ the guns were loaded with ball, and Top, who led the van, received orders to beat\
  \ about the edge of the forest.</p>"
- <p>From the extremity of the promontory which formed the tail of the peninsula the
  coast was rounded for a distance of five miles, which was rapidly passed over, without
  even the most minute investigations bringing to light the least trace of any old
  or recent landings; no debris, no mark of an encampment, no cinders of a fire, nor
  even a footprint!</p>
- "<p>From the point of the peninsula on which the settlers now were their gaze could\
  \ extend along the southwest. Twenty\u2011five miles off the coast terminated in\
  \ the Claw Cape, which loomed dimly through the morning mists, and which, by the\
  \ phenomenon of the mirage, appeared as if suspended between land and water.</p>"
- <p>Between the place occupied by the colonists and the other side of the immense
  bay, the shore was composed, first, of a tract of low land, bordered in the background
  by trees; then the shore became more irregular, projecting sharp points into the
  sea, and finally ended in the black rocks which, accumulated in picturesque disorder,
  formed Claw Cape.</p>
- <p>Such was the development of this part of the island, which the settlers took
  in at a glance, while stopping for an instant.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIf a vessel ran in here,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cshe would certainly\
  \ be lost. Sandbanks and reefs everywhere! Bad quarters!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut at least something would be left of the ship,\u201D observed the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere might be pieces of wood on the rocks, but nothing on the sands,\u201D\
  \ replied the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBecause the sands are still more dangerous than the rocks, for they swallow\
  \ up everything that is thrown on them. In a few days the hull of a ship of several\
  \ hundred tons would disappear entirely in there!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSo, Pencroft,\u201D asked the engineer, \u201Cif a ship has been wrecked\
  \ on these banks, is it not astonishing that there is now no trace of her remaining?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, captain, with the aid of time and tempest. However, it would be surprising,\
  \ even in this case, that some of the masts or spars should not have been thrown\
  \ on the beach, out of reach of the waves.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us go on with our search, then,\u201D returned Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>At one o\u2019clock the colonists arrived at the other side of Washington Bay,\
  \ they having now gone a distance of twenty miles.</p>"
- <p>They then halted for breakfast.</p>
- "<p>Here began the irregular coast, covered with lines of rocks and sandbanks. The\
  \ long sea\u2011swell could be seen breaking over the rocks in the bay, forming\
  \ a foamy fringe. From this point to Claw Cape the beach was very narrow between\
  \ the edge of the forest and the reefs.</p>"
- <p>Walking was now more difficult, on account of the numerous rocks which encumbered
  the beach. The granite cliff also gradually increased in height, and only the green
  tops of the trees which crowned it could be seen.</p>
- "<p>After half an hour\u2019s rest, the settlers resumed their journey, and not\
  \ a spot among the rocks was left unexamined. Pencroft and Neb even rushed into\
  \ the surf whenever any object attracted their attention. But they found nothing,\
  \ some curious formations of the rocks having deceived them. They ascertained, however,\
  \ that eatable shellfish abounded there, but these could not be of any great advantage\
  \ to them until some easy means of communication had been established between the\
  \ two banks of the Mercy, and until the means of transport had been perfected.</p>"
- <p>Nothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck could be found
  on this shore, yet an object of any importance, such as the hull of a ship, would
  have been seen directly, or any of her masts and spars would have been washed on
  shore, just as the chest had been, which was found twenty miles from here. But there
  was nothing.</p>
- "<p>Towards three o\u2019clock Harding and his companions arrived at a snug little\
  \ creek. It formed quite a natural harbor, invisible from the sea, and was entered\
  \ by a narrow channel.</p>"
- "<p>At the back of this creek some violent convulsion had torn up the rocky border,\
  \ and a cutting, by a gentle slope, gave access to an upper plateau, which might\
  \ be situated at least ten miles from Claw Cape, and consequently four miles in\
  \ a straight line from Prospect Heights. Gideon Spilett proposed to his companions\
  \ that they should make a halt here. They agreed readily, for their walk had sharpened\
  \ their appetites; and although it was not their usual dinner\u2011hour, no one\
  \ refused to strengthen himself with a piece of venison. This luncheon would sustain\
  \ them until their supper, which they intended to take at Granite House. In a few\
  \ minutes the settlers, seated under a clump of fine sea\u2011pines, were devouring\
  \ the provisions which Neb produced from his bag.</p>"
- <p>This spot was raised from fifty to sixty feet above the level of the sea. The
  view was very extensive, but beyond the cape it ended in Union Bay. Neither the
  islet nor Prospect Heights was visible, and could not be from thence, for the rising
  ground and the curtain of trees closed the northern horizon.</p>
- <p>It is useless to add that notwithstanding the wide extent of sea which the explorers
  could survey, and though the engineer swept the horizon with his glass, no vessel
  could be found.</p>
- <p>The shore was of course examined with the same care from the edge of the water
  to the cliff, and nothing could be discovered even with the aid of the instrument.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cit seems we must make up our minds\
  \ to console ourselves with thinking that no one will come to dispute with us the\
  \ possession of Lincoln Island!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut the bullet,\u201D cried Herbert. \u201CThat was not imaginary, I suppose!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CHang it, no!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, thinking of his absent tooth.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen what conclusion may be drawn?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cthat three months or more ago,\
  \ a vessel, either voluntarily or not, came here.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat! then you admit, Cyrus, that she was swallowed up without leaving\
  \ any trace?\u201D cried the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, my dear Spilett; but you see that if it is certain that a human being\
  \ set foot on the island, it appears no less certain that he has now left it.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen, if I understand you right, captain,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cthe\
  \ vessel has left again?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CEvidently.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?\u201D said\
  \ Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI fear so.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery well, since the opportunity is lost, let us go on; it can\u2019t\
  \ be helped,\u201D said Pencroft, who felt home\u2011sickness for Granite House.</p>"
- <p>But just as they were rising, Top was heard loudly barking; and the dog issued
  from the wood, holding in his mouth a rag soiled with mud.</p>
- <p>Neb seized it. It was a piece of strong cloth!</p>
- <p>Top still barked, and by his going and coming, seemed to invite his master to
  follow him into the forest.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNow there\u2019s something to explain the bullet!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA castaway!\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWounded, perhaps!\u201D said Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COr dead!\u201D added the reporter.</p>"
- <p>All ran after the dog, among the tall pines on the border of the forest. Harding
  and his companions made ready their firearms, in case of an emergency.</p>
- <p>They advanced some way into the wood, but to their great disappointment, they
  as yet saw no signs of any human being having passed that way. Shrubs and creepers
  were uninjured, and they had even to cut them away with the axe, as they had done
  in the deepest recesses of the forest. It was difficult to fancy that any human
  creature had ever passed there, but yet Top went backward and forward, not like
  a dog who searches at random, but like a dog being endowed with a mind, who is following
  up an idea.</p>
- <p>In about seven or eight minutes Top stopped in a glade surrounded with tall trees.
  The settlers gazed around them, but saw nothing, neither under the bushes nor among
  the trees.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat is the matter, Top?\u201D said Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>Top barked louder, bounding about at the foot of a gigantic pine. All at once\
  \ Pencroft shouted,?\u201CHo, splendid! capital!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D asked Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe have been looking for a wreck at sea or on land!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell; and here we\u2019ve found one in the air!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And the sailor pointed to a great white rag, caught in the top of the pine, a
  fallen scrap of which the dog had brought to them.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut that is not a wreck!\u201D cried Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI beg your pardon!\u201D returned Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy? is it??\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is all that remains of our airy boat, of our balloon, which has been\
  \ caught up aloft there, at the top of that tree!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Pencroft was not mistaken, and he gave vent to his feelings in a tremendous hurrah,
  adding,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CThere is good cloth! There is what will furnish us with linen for years.\
  \ There is what will make us handkerchiefs and shirts! Ha, ha, Mr. Spilett, what\
  \ do you say to an island where shirts grow on the trees?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>It was certainly a lucky circumstance for the settlers in Lincoln Island that\
  \ the balloon, after having made its last bound into the air, had fallen on the\
  \ island and thus given them the opportunity of finding it again, whether they kept\
  \ the case under its present form, or whether they wished to attempt another escape\
  \ by it, or whether they usefully employed the several hundred yards of cotton,\
  \ which was of fine quality. Pencroft\u2019s joy was therefore shared by all.</p>"
- <p>But it was necessary to bring down the remains of the balloon from the tree,
  to place it in security, and this was no slight task. Neb, Herbert, and the sailor,
  climbing to the summit of the tree, used all their skill to disengage the now reduced
  balloon.</p>
- <p>The operation lasted two hours, and then not only the case, with its valve, its
  springs, its brasswork, lay on the ground, but the net, that is to say a considerable
  quantity of ropes and cordage, and the circle and the anchor. The case, except for
  the fracture, was in good condition, only the lower portion being torn.</p>
- <p>It was a fortune which had fallen from the sky.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAll the same, captain,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cif we ever decide\
  \ to leave the island, it won\u2019t be in a balloon, will it? These airboats won\u2019\
  t go where we want them to go, and we have had some experience in that way! Look\
  \ here, we will build a craft of some twenty tons, and then we can make a main\u2011\
  sail, a foresail, and a jib out of that cloth. As to the rest of it, that will help\
  \ to dress us.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall see, Pencroft,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding; \u201Cwe shall see.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn the meantime, we must put it in a safe place,\u201D said Neb.</p>"
- <p>They certainly could not think of carrying this load of cloth, ropes, and cordage,
  to Granite House, for the weight of it was very considerable, and while waiting
  for a suitable vehicle in which to convey it, it was of importance that this treasure
  should not be left longer exposed to the mercies of the first storm. The settlers,
  uniting their efforts, managed to drag it as far as the shore, where they discovered
  a large rocky cavity, which owing to its position could not be visited either by
  the wind or rain.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe needed a locker, and now we have one,\u201D said Pencroft; \u201Cbut\
  \ as we cannot lock it up, it will be prudent to hide the opening. I don\u2019t\
  \ mean from two\u2011legged thieves, but from those with four paws!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>At six o\u2019clock, all was stowed away, and after having given the creek the\
  \ very suitable name of \u201CPort Balloon,\u201D the settlers pursued their way\
  \ along Claw Cape. Pencroft and the engineer talked of the different projects which\
  \ it was agreed to put into execution with the briefest possible delay. It was necessary\
  \ first of all to throw a bridge over the Mercy, so as to establish an easy communication\
  \ with the south of the island; then the cart must be taken to bring back the balloon,\
  \ for the canoe alone could not carry it, then they would build a decked boat, and\
  \ Pencroft would rig it as a cutter, and they would be able to undertake voyages\
  \ of circumnavigation round the island, etc.</p>"
- <p>In the meanwhile night came on, and it was already dark when the settlers reached
  Flotsam Point, where they had found the precious chest.</p>
- <p>The distance between Flotsam Point and Granite House was another four miles,
  and it was midnight when, after having followed the shore to the mouth of the Mercy,
  the settlers arrived at the first angle formed by the Mercy.</p>
- <p>There the river was eighty feet in breadth, which was awkward to cross, but as
  Pencroft had taken upon himself to conquer this difficulty, he was compelled to
  do it. The settlers certainly had reason to be pretty tired. The journey had been
  long, and the task of getting down the balloon had not rested either their arms
  or legs. They were anxious to reach Granite House to eat and sleep, and if the bridge
  had been constructed, in a quarter of an hour they would have been at home.</p>
- <p>The night was very dark. Pencroft prepared to keep his promise by constructing
  a sort of raft, on which to make the passage of the Mercy. He and Neb, armed with
  axes, chose two trees near the water, and began to attack them at the base.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and Spilett, seated on the bank, waited till their companions were
  ready for their help, while Herbert roamed about, though without going to any distance.
  All at once, the lad, who had strolled by the river, came running back, and, pointing
  up the Mercy, exclaimed,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat is floating there?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Pencroft stopped working, and seeing an indistinct object moving through the
  gloom,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CA canoe!\u201D cried he.</p>"
- <p>All approached, and saw to their extreme surprise, a boat floating down the current.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBoat ahoy!\u201D shouted the sailor, without thinking that perhaps it\
  \ would be best to keep silence.</p>"
- <p>No reply. The boat still drifted onward, and it was not more than twelve feet
  off, when the sailor exclaimed,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut it is our own boat! she has broken her moorings, and floated down\
  \ the current. I must say she has arrived very opportunely.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COur boat?\u201D murmured the engineer.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft was right. It was indeed the canoe, of which the rope had undoubtedly
  broken, and which had come alone from the sources of the Mercy. It was very important
  to seize it before the rapid current should have swept it away out of the mouth
  of the river, but Neb and Pencroft cleverly managed this by means of a long pole.</p>
- <p>The canoe touched the shore. The engineer leaped in first, and found, on examining
  the rope, that it had been really worn through by rubbing against the rocks.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D said the reporter to him, in a low voice, \u201Cthis is a\
  \ strange thing.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CStrange indeed!\u201D returned Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- <p>Strange or not, it was very fortunate. Herbert, the reporter, Neb, and Pencroft,
  embarked in turn. There was no doubt about the rope having been worn through, but
  the astonishing part of the affair was, that the boat should arrive just at the
  moment when the settlers were there to seize it on its way, for a quarter of an
  hour earlier or later it would have been lost in the sea.</p>
- <p>If they had been living in the time of genii, this incident would have given
  them the right to think that the island was haunted by some supernatural being,
  who used his power in the service of the castaways!</p>
- <p>A few strokes of the oar brought the settlers to the mouth of the Mercy. The
  canoe was hauled up on the beach near the Chimneys, and all proceeded towards the
  ladder of Granite House.</p>
- <p>But at that moment, Top barked angrily, and Neb, who was looking for the first
  steps, uttered a cry.</p>
- <p>There was no longer a ladder!</p>
- <p>Chapter 6</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding stood still, without saying a word. His companions searched in\
  \ the darkness on the wall, in case the wind should have moved the ladder, and on\
  \ the ground, thinking that it might have fallen down.... But the ladder had quite\
  \ disappeared. As to ascertaining if a squall had blown it on the landing\u2011\
  place, half way up, that was impossible in the dark.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf it is a joke,\u201D cried Pencroft, \u201Cit is a very stupid one!\
  \ To come home and find no staircase to go up to your room by?that\u2019s nothing\
  \ for weary men to laugh at.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Neb could do nothing but cry out \u201COh! oh! oh!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI begin to think that very curious things happen in Lincoln Island!\u201D\
  \ said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCurious?\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, \u201Cnot at all, Pencroft, nothing\
  \ can be more natural. Some one has come during our absence, taken possession of\
  \ our dwelling and drawn up the ladder.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSome one,\u201D cried the sailor. \u201CBut who?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho but the hunter who fired the bullet?\u201D replied the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, if there is any one up there,\u201D replied Pencroft, who began\
  \ to lose patience, \u201CI will give them a hail, and they must answer.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>And in a stentorian voice the sailor gave a prolonged \u201CHalloo!\u201D which\
  \ was echoed again and again from the cliff and rocks.</p>"
- <p>The settlers listened and they thought they heard a sort of chuckling laugh,
  of which they could not guess the origin. But no voice replied to Pencroft, who
  in vain repeated his vigorous shouts.</p>
- <p>There was something indeed in this to astonish the most apathetic of men, and
  the settlers were not men of that description. In their situation every incident
  had its importance, and, certainly, during the seven months which they had spent
  on the island, they had not before met with anything of so surprising a character.</p>
- <p>Be that as it may, forgetting their fatigue in the singularity of the event,
  they remained below Granite House, not knowing what to think, not knowing what to
  do, questioning each other without any hope of a satisfactory reply, every one starting
  some supposition each more unlikely than the last. Neb bewailed himself, much disappointed
  at not being able to get into his kitchen, for the provisions which they had had
  on their expedition were exhausted, and they had no means of renewing them.</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friends,\u201D at last said Cyrus Harding, \u201Cthere is only one\
  \ thing to be done at present; wait for day, and then act according to circumstances.\
  \ But let us go to the Chimneys. There we shall be under shelter, and if we cannot\
  \ eat, we can at least sleep.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut who is it that has played us this cool trick?\u201D again asked Pencroft,\
  \ unable to make up his mind to retire from the spot.</p>"
- <p>Whoever it was, the only thing practicable was to do as the engineer proposed,
  to go to the Chimneys and there wait for day. In the meanwhile Top was ordered to
  mount guard below the windows of Granite House, and when Top received an order he
  obeyed it without any questioning. The brave dog therefore remained at the foot
  of the cliff while his master with his companions sought a refuge among the rocks.</p>
- <p>To say that the settlers, notwithstanding their fatigue, slept well on the sandy
  floor of the Chimneys would not be true. It was not only that they were extremely
  anxious to find out the cause of what had happened, whether it was the result of
  an accident which would be discovered at the return of day, or whether on the contrary
  it was the work of a human being; but they also had very uncomfortable beds. That
  could not be helped, however, for in some way or other at that moment their dwelling
  was occupied, and they could not possibly enter it.</p>
- <p>Now Granite House was more than their dwelling, it was their warehouse. There
  were all the stores belonging to the colony, weapons, instruments, tools, ammunition,
  provisions, etc. To think that all that might be pillaged and that the settlers
  would have all their work to do over again, fresh weapons and tools to make, was
  a serious matter. Their uneasiness led one or other of them also to go out every
  few minutes to see if Top was keeping good watch. Cyrus Harding alone waited with
  his habitual patience, although his strong mind was exasperated at being confronted
  with such an inexplicable fact, and he was provoked at himself for allowing a feeling
  to which he could not give a name, to gain an influence over him. Gideon Spilett
  shared his feelings in this respect, and the two conversed together in whispers
  of the inexplicable circumstance which baffled even their intelligence and experience.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is a joke,\u201D said Pencroft; \u201Cit is a trick some one has played\
  \ us. Well, I don\u2019t like such jokes, and the joker had better look out for\
  \ himself, if he falls into my hands, I can tell him.\u201D</p>"
- <p>As soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east, the colonists, suitably
  armed, repaired to the beach under Granite House. The rising sun now shone on the
  cliff and they could see the windows, the shutters of which were closed, through
  the curtains of foliage.</p>
- <p>All here was in order; but a cry escaped the colonists when they saw that the
  door, which they had closed on their departure, was now wide open.</p>
- <p>Some one had entered Granite House?there could be no more doubt about that.</p>
- <p>The upper ladder, which generally hung from the door to the landing, was in its
  place, but the lower ladder was drawn up and raised to the threshold. It was evident
  that the intruders had wished to guard themselves against a surprise.</p>
- <p>Pencroft hailed again.</p>
- <p>No reply.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe beggars,\u201D exclaimed the sailor. \u201CThere they are sleeping\
  \ quietly as if they were in their own house. Hallo there, you pirates, brigands,\
  \ robbers, sons of John Bull!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>When Pencroft, being a Yankee, treated any one to the epithet of \u201Cson of\
  \ John Bull,\u201D he considered he had reached the last limits of insult.</p>"
- <p>The sun had now completely risen, and the whole facade of Granite House became
  illuminated by its rays; but in the interior as well as on the exterior all was
  quiet and calm.</p>
- <p>The settlers asked if Granite House was inhabited or not, and yet the position
  of the ladder was sufficient to show that it was; it was also certain that the inhabitants,
  whoever they might be, had not been able to escape. But how were they to be got
  at?</p>
- "<p>Herbert then thought of fastening a cord to an arrow, and shooting the arrow\
  \ so that it should pass between the first rounds of the ladder which hung from\
  \ the threshold. By means of the cord they would then be able to draw down the ladder\
  \ to the ground, and so re\u2011establish the communication between the beach and\
  \ Granite House. There was evidently nothing else to be done, and, with a little\
  \ skill, this method might succeed. Very fortunately bows and arrows had been left\
  \ at the Chimneys, where they also found a quantity of light hibiscus cord. Pencroft\
  \ fastened this to a well\u2011feathered arrow. Then Herbert fixing it to his bow,\
  \ took a careful aim for the lower part of the ladder.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb drew back, so as to see if anything
  appeared at the windows. The reporter lifted his gun to his shoulder and covered
  the door.</p>
- <p>The bow was bent, the arrow flew, taking the cord with it, and passed between
  the two last rounds.</p>
- <p>The operation had succeeded.</p>
- <p>Herbert immediately seized the end of the cord, but, at that moment when he gave
  it a pull to bring down the ladder, an arm, thrust suddenly out between the wall
  and the door, grasped it and dragged it inside Granite House.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe rascals!\u201D shouted the sailor. \u201CIf a ball can do anything\
  \ for you, you shall not have long to wait for it.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut who was it?\u201D asked Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho was it? Didn\u2019t you see?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt was a monkey, a sapajou, an orangoutang, a baboon, a gorilla, a sagoin.\
  \ Our dwelling has been invaded by monkeys, who climbed up the ladder during our\
  \ absence.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>And, at this moment, as if to bear witness to the truth of the sailor\u2019\
  s words, two or three quadrumana showed themselves at the windows, from which they\
  \ had pushed back the shutters, and saluted the real proprietors of the place with\
  \ a thousand hideous grimaces.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI knew that it was only a joke,\u201D cried Pencroft; \u201Cbut one of\
  \ the jokers shall pay the penalty for the rest.\u201D</p>"
- <p>So saying, the sailor, raising his piece, took a rapid aim at one of the monkeys
  and fired. All disappeared, except one who fell mortally wounded on the beach. This
  monkey, which was of a large size, evidently belonged to the first order of the
  quadrumana. Whether this was a chimpanzee, an orangoutang, or a gorilla, he took
  rank among the anthropoid apes, who are so called from their resemblance to the
  human race. However, Herbert declared it to be an orangoutang.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat a magnificent beast!\u201D cried Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMagnificent, if you like,\u201D replied Pencroft; \u201Cbut still I do\
  \ not see how we are to get into our house.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHerbert is a good marksman,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cand his bow\
  \ is here. He can try again.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy, these apes are so cunning,\u201D returned Pencroft; \u201Cthey won\u2019\
  t show themselves again at the windows and so we can\u2019t kill them; and when\
  \ I think of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHave patience,\u201D replied Harding; \u201Cthese creatures cannot keep\
  \ us long at bay.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI shall not be sure of that till I see them down here,\u201D replied the\
  \ sailor. \u201CAnd now, captain, do you know how many dozens of these fellows are\
  \ up there?\u201D</p>"
- <p>It was difficult to reply to Pencroft, and as for the young boy making another
  attempt, that was not easy; for the lower part of the ladder had been drawn again
  into the door, and when another pull was given, the line broke and the ladder remained
  firm. The case was really perplexing. Pencroft stormed. There was a comic side to
  the situation, but he did not think it funny at all. It was certain that the settlers
  would end by reinstating themselves in their domicile and driving out the intruders,
  but when and how? this is what they were not able to say.</p>
- "<p>Two hours passed, during which the apes took care not to show themselves, but\
  \ they were still there, and three or four times a nose or a paw was poked out at\
  \ the door or windows, and was immediately saluted by a gun\u2011shot.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us hide ourselves,\u201D at last said the engineer. \u201CPerhaps\
  \ the apes will think we have gone quite away and will show themselves again. Let\
  \ Spilett and Herbert conceal themselves behind those rocks and fire on all that\
  \ may appear.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The engineer\u2019s orders were obeyed, and while the reporter and the lad,\
  \ the best marksmen in the colony, posted themselves in a good position, but out\
  \ of the monkeys\u2019 sight, Neb, Pencroft, and Cyrus climbed the plateau and entered\
  \ the forest in order to kill some game, for it was now time for breakfast and they\
  \ had no provisions remaining.</p>"
- <p>In half an hour the hunters returned with a few rock pigeons, which they roasted
  as well as they could. Not an ape had appeared. Gideon Spilett and Herbert went
  to take their share of the breakfast, leaving Top to watch under the windows. They
  then, having eaten, returned to their post.</p>
- "<p>Two hours later, their situation was in no degree improved. The quadrumana gave\
  \ no sign of existence, and it might have been supposed that they had disappeared;\
  \ but what seemed more probable was that, terrified by the death of one of their\
  \ companions, and frightened by the noise of the firearms, they had retreated to\
  \ the back part of the house or probably even into the store\u2011room. And when\
  \ they thought of the valuables which this storeroom contained, the patience so\
  \ much recommended by the engineer, fast changed into great irritation, and there\
  \ certainly was room for it.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDecidedly it is too bad,\u201D said the reporter; \u201Cand the worst\
  \ of it is, there is no way of putting an end to it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut we must drive these vagabonds out somehow,\u201D cried the sailor.\
  \ \u201CWe could soon get the better of them, even if there are twenty of the rascals;\
  \ but for that, we must meet them hand to hand. Come now, is there no way of getting\
  \ at them?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us try to enter Granite House by the old opening at the lake,\u201D\
  \ replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh!\u201D shouted the sailor, \u201Cand I never thought of that.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>This was in reality the only way by which to penetrate into Granite House so
  as to fight with and drive out the intruders. The opening was, it is true, closed
  up with a wall of cemented stones, which it would be necessary to sacrifice, but
  that could easily be rebuilt. Fortunately, Cyrus Harding had not as yet effected
  his project of hiding this opening by raising the waters of the lake, for the operation
  would then have taken some time.</p>
- "<p>It was already past twelve o\u2019clock, when the colonists, well armed and\
  \ provided with picks and spades, left the Chimneys, passed beneath the windows\
  \ of Granite House, after telling Top to remain at his post, and began to ascend\
  \ the left bank of the Mercy, so as to reach Prospect Heights.</p>"
- <p>But they had not made fifty steps in this direction, when they heard the dog
  barking furiously.</p>
- <p>And all rushed down the bank again.</p>
- <p>Arrived at the turning, they saw that the situation had changed.</p>
- <p>In fact, the apes, seized with a sudden panic, from some unknown cause, were
  trying to escape. Two or three ran and clambered from one window to another with
  the agility of acrobats. They were not even trying to replace the ladder, by which
  it would have been easy to descend; perhaps in their terror they had forgotten this
  way of escape. The colonists, now being able to take aim without difficulty, fired.
  Some, wounded or killed, fell back into the rooms, uttering piercing cries. The
  rest, throwing themselves out, were dashed to pieces in their fall, and in a few
  minutes, so far as they knew, there was not a living quadrumana in Granite House.</p>
- <p>At this moment the ladder was seen to slip over the threshold, then unroll and
  fall to the ground.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHullo!\u201D cried the sailor, \u201Cthis is queer!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery strange!\u201D murmured the engineer, leaping first up the ladder.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTake care, captain!\u201D cried Pencroft, \u201Cperhaps there are still\
  \ some of these rascals.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall soon see,\u201D replied the engineer, without stopping however.</p>"
- <p>All his companions followed him, and in a minute they had arrived at the threshold.
  They searched everywhere. There was no one in the rooms nor in the storehouse, which
  had been respected by the band of quadrumana.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell now, and the ladder,\u201D cried the sailor; \u201Cwho can the gentleman\
  \ have been who sent us that down?\u201D</p>"
- <p>But at that moment a cry was heard, and a great orang, who had hidden himself
  in the passage, rushed into the room, pursued by Neb.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAh, the robber!\u201D cried Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>And hatchet in hand, he was about to cleave the head of the animal, when Cyrus
  Harding seized his arm, saying,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CSpare him, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPardon this rascal?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes! it was he who threw us the ladder!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And the engineer said this in such a peculiar voice that it was difficult to
  know whether he spoke seriously or not.</p>
- <p>Nevertheless, they threw themselves on the orang, who defended himself gallantly,
  but was soon overpowered and bound.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThere!\u201D said Pencroft. \u201CAnd what shall we make of him, now we\u2019\
  ve got him?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA servant!\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- <p>The lad was not joking in saying this, for he knew how this intelligent race
  could be turned to account.</p>
- <p>The settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it attentively. He belonged
  to the family of anthropoid apes, of which the facial angle is not much inferior
  to that of the Australians and Hottentots. It was an orangoutang, and as such, had
  neither the ferocity of the gorilla, nor the stupidity of the baboon. It is to this
  family of the anthropoid apes that so many characteristics belong which prove them
  to be possessed of an almost human intelligence. Employed in houses, they can wait
  at table, sweep rooms, brush clothes, clean boots, handle a knife, fork, and spoon
  properly, and even drink wine... doing everything as well as the best servant that
  ever walked upon two legs. Buffon possessed one of these apes, who served him for
  a long time as a faithful and zealous servant.</p>
- "<p>The one which had been seized in the hall of Granite House was a great fellow,\
  \ six feet high, with an admirably poportioned frame, a broad chest, head of a moderate\
  \ size, the facial angle reaching sixty\u2011five degrees, round skull, projecting\
  \ nose, skin covered with soft glossy hair, in short, a fine specimen of the anthropoids.\
  \ His eyes, rather smaller than human eyes, sparkled with intelligence; his white\
  \ teeth glittered under his mustache, and he wore a little curly brown beard.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA handsome fellow!\u201D said Pencroft; \u201Cif we only knew his language,\
  \ we could talk to him.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, master,\u201D said Neb, \u201Care you serious? Are we going to take\
  \ him as a servant?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Neb,\u201D replied the engineer, smiling. \u201CBut you must not\
  \ be jealous.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd I hope he will make an excellent servant,\u201D added Herbert. \u201C\
  He appears young, and will be easy to educate, and we shall not be obliged to use\
  \ force to subdue him, nor draw his teeth, as is sometimes done. He will soon grow\
  \ fond of his masters if they are kind to him.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd they will be,\u201D replied Pencroft, who had forgotten all his rancor\
  \ against \u201Cthe jokers.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Then, approaching the orang,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, old boy!\u201D he asked, \u201Chow are you?\u201D</p>"
- <p>The orang replied by a little grunt which did not show any anger.</p>
- "<p>\u201CYou wish to join the colony?\u201D again asked the sailor. \u201CYou are\
  \ going to enter the service of Captain Cyrus Harding?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Another respondent grunt was uttered by the ape.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAnd you will be satisfied with no other wages than your food?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Third affirmative grunt.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThis conversation is slightly monotonous,\u201D observed Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSo much the better,\u201D replied Pencroft; \u201Cthe best servants are\
  \ those who talk the least. And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy? We will give\
  \ you no wages at first, but we will double them afterwards if we are pleased with\
  \ you.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Thus the colony was increased by a new member. As to his name the sailor begged
  that in memory of another ape which he had known, he might be called Jupiter, and
  Jup for short.</p>
- <p>And so, without more ceremony, Master Jup was installed in Granite House.</p>
- <p>Chapter 7</p>
- "<p>The settlers in Lincoln Island had now regained their dwelling, without having\
  \ been obliged to reach it by the old opening, and were therefore spared the trouble\
  \ of mason\u2019s work. It was certainly lucky, that at the moment they were about\
  \ to set out to do so, the apes had been seized with that terror, no less sudden\
  \ than inexplicable, which had driven them out of Granite House. Had the animals\
  \ discovered that they were about to be attacked from another direction? This was\
  \ the only explanation of their sudden retreat.</p>"
- "<p>During the day the bodies of the apes were carried into the wood, where they\
  \ were buried; then the settlers busied themselves in repairing the disorder caused\
  \ by the intruders, disorder but not damage, for although they had turned everything\
  \ in the rooms topsy\u2011turvy, yet they had broken nothing. Neb relighted his\
  \ stove, and the stores in the larder furnished a substantial repast, to which all\
  \ did ample justice.</p>"
- <p>Jup was not forgotten, and he ate with relish some stonepine almonds and rhizome
  roots, with which he was abundantly supplied. Pencroft had unfastened his arms,
  but judged it best to have his legs tied until they were more sure of his submission.</p>
- <p>Then, before retiring to rest, Harding and his companions seated round their
  table, discussed those plans, the execution of which was most pressing. The most
  important and most urgent was the establishment of a bridge over the Mercy, so as
  to form a communication with the southern part of the island and Granite House;
  then the making of an enclosure for the musmons or other woolly animals which they
  wished to capture.</p>
- <p>These two projects would help to solve the difficulty as to their clothing, which
  was now serious. The bridge would render easy the transport of the balloon case,
  which would furnish them with linen, and the inhabitants of the enclosure would
  yield wool which would supply them with winter clothes.</p>
- "<p>As to the enclosure, it was Cyrus Harding\u2019s intention to establish it at\
  \ the sources of the Red Creek, where the ruminants would find fresh and abundant\
  \ pasture. The road between Prospect Heights and the sources of the stream was already\
  \ partly beaten, and with a better cart than the first, the material could be easily\
  \ conveyed to the spot, especially if they could manage to capture some animals\
  \ to draw it.</p>"
- "<p>But though there might be no inconvenience in the enclosure being so far from\
  \ Granite House, it would not be the same with the poultry\u2011yard, to which Neb\
  \ called the attention of the colonists. It was indeed necessary that the birds\
  \ should be close within reach of the cook, and no place appeared more favorable\
  \ for the establishment of the said poultry\u2011yard than that portion of the banks\
  \ of the lake which was close to the old opening.</p>"
- "<p>Water\u2011birds would prosper there as well as others, and the couple of tinamous\
  \ taken in their last excursion would be the first to be domesticated.</p>"
- <p>The next day, the 3rd of November, the new works were begun by the construction
  of the bridge, and all hands were required for this important task. Saws, hatchets,
  and hammers were shouldered by the settlers, who, now transformed into carpenters,
  descended to the shore.</p>
- <p>There Pencroft observed,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CSuppose, that during our absence, Master Jup takes it into his head to\
  \ draw up the ladder which he so politely returned to us yesterday?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us tie its lower end down firmly,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- <p>This was done by means of two stakes securely fixed in the sand. Then the settlers,
  ascending the left bank of the Mercy, soon arrived at the angle formed by the river.</p>
- <p>There they halted, in order to ascertain if the bridge could be thrown across.
  The place appeared suitable.</p>
- "<p>In fact, from this spot, to Port Balloon, discovered the day before on the southern\
  \ coast, there was only a distance of three miles and a half, and from the bridge\
  \ to the Port, it would be easy to make a good cart\u2011road which would render\
  \ the communication between Granite House and the south of the island extremely\
  \ easy.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding now imparted to his companions a scheme for completely isolating\
  \ Prospect Heights so as to shelter it from the attacks both of quadrupeds and quadrumana.\
  \ In this way, Granite House, the Chimneys, the poultry\u2011yard, and all the upper\
  \ part of the plateau which was to be used for cultivation, would be protected against\
  \ the depredations of animals. Nothing could be easier than to execute this project,\
  \ and this is how the engineer intended to set to work.</p>"
- "<p>The plateau was already defended on three sides by water\u2011courses, either\
  \ artificial or natural. On the northwest, by the shores of Lake Grant, from the\
  \ entrance of the passage to the breach made in the banks of the lake for the escape\
  \ of the water.</p>"
- "<p>On the north, from this breach to the sea, by the new water\u2011course which\
  \ had hollowed out a bed for itself across the plateau and shore, above and below\
  \ the fall, and it would be enough to dig the bed of this creek a little deeper\
  \ to make it impracticable for animals, on all the eastern border by the sea itself,\
  \ from the mouth of the aforesaid creek to the mouth of the Mercy.</p>"
- <p>Lastly, on the south, from the mouth to the turn of the Mercy where the bridge
  was to be established.</p>
- <p>The western border of the plateau now remained between the turn of the river
  and the southern angle of the lake, a distance of about a mile, which was open to
  all comers. But nothing could be easier than to dig a broad deep ditch, which could
  be filled from the lake, and the overflow of which would throw itself by a rapid
  fall into the bed of the Mercy. The level of the lake would, no doubt, be somewhat
  lowered by this fresh discharge of its waters, but Cyrus Harding had ascertained
  that the volume of water in the Red Creek was considerable enough to allow of the
  execution of this project.</p>
- "<p>\u201CSo then,\u201D added the engineer, \u201CProspect Heights will become\
  \ a regular island, being surrounded with water on all sides, and only communicating\
  \ with the rest of our domain by the bridge which we are about to throw across the\
  \ Mercy, the two little bridges already established above and below the fall; and,\
  \ lastly, two other little bridges which must be constructed, one over the canal\
  \ which I propose to dig, the other across to the left bank of the Mercy. Now, if\
  \ these bridges can be raised at will, Prospect Heights will be guarded from any\
  \ surprise.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The bridge was the most urgent work. Trees were selected, cut down, stripped
  of their branches, and cut into beams, joists, and planks. The end of the bridge
  which rested on the right bank of the Mercy was to be firm, but the other end on
  the left bank was to be movable, so that it might be raised by means of a counterpoise,
  as some canal bridges are managed.</p>
- "<p>This was certainly a considerable work, and though it was skillfully conducted,\
  \ it took some time, for the Mercy at this place was eighty feet wide. It was therefore\
  \ necessary to fix piles in the bed of the river so as to sustain the floor of the\
  \ bridge and establish a pile\u2011driver to act on the tops of these piles, which\
  \ would thus form two arches and allow the bridge to support heavy loads.</p>"
- "<p>Happily there was no want of tools with which to shape the wood, nor of iron\u2011\
  work to make it firm, nor of the ingenuity of a man who had a marvelous knowledge\
  \ of the work, nor lastly, the zeal of his companions, who in seven months had necessarily\
  \ acquired great skill in the use of their tools; and it must be said that not the\
  \ least skilful was Gideon Spilett, who in dexterity almost equaled the sailor himself.\
  \ \u201CWho would ever have expected so much from a newspaper man!\u201D thought\
  \ Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>The construction of the Mercy bridge lasted three weeks of regular hard work.
  They even breakfasted on the scene of their labors, and the weather being magnificent,
  they only returned to Granite House to sleep.</p>
- <p>During this period it may be stated that Master Jup grew more accustomed to his
  new masters, whose movements he always watched with very inquisitive eyes. However,
  as a precautionary measure, Pencroft did not as yet allow him complete liberty,
  rightly wishing to wait until the limits of the plateau should be settled by the
  projected works. Top and Jup were good friends and played willingly together, but
  Jup did everything solemnly.</p>
- "<p>On the 20th of November the bridge was finished. The movable part, balanced\
  \ by the counterpoise, swung easily, and only a slight effort was needed to raise\
  \ it; between its hinge and the last cross\u2011bar on which it rested when closed,\
  \ there existed a space of twenty feet, which was sufficiently wide to prevent any\
  \ animals from crossing.</p>"
- "<p>The settlers now began to talk of fetching the balloon\u2011case, which they\
  \ were anxious to place in perfect security; but to bring it, it would be necessary\
  \ to take a cart to Port Balloon, and consequently, necessary to beat a road through\
  \ the dense forests of the Far West. This would take some time. Also, Neb and Pencroft\
  \ having gone to examine into the state of things at Port Balloon, and reported\
  \ that the stock of cloth would suffer no damage in the grotto where it was stored,\
  \ it was decided that the work at Prospect Heights should not be discontinued.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat,\u201D observed Pencroft, \u201Cwill enable us to establish our poultry\u2011\
  yard under better conditions, since we need have no fear of visits from foxes nor\
  \ the attacks of other beasts.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen,\u201D added Neb, \u201Cwe can clear the plateau, and transplant\
  \ wild plants to it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd prepare our second corn\u2011field!\u201D cried the sailor with a\
  \ triumphant air.</p>"
- "<p>In fact, the first corn\u2011field sown with a single grain had prospered admirably,\
  \ thanks to Pencroft\u2019s care. It had produced the ten ears foretold by the engineer,\
  \ and each ear containing eighty grains, the colony found itself in possession of\
  \ eight hundred grains, in six months, which promised a double harvest each year.</p>"
- <p>These eight hundred grains, except fifty, which were prudently reserved, were
  to be sown in a new field, but with no less care than was bestowed on the single
  grain.</p>
- "<p>The field was prepared, then surrounded with a strong palisade, high and pointed,\
  \ which quadrupeds would have found difficulty in leaping. As to birds, some scarecrows,\
  \ due to Pencroft\u2019s ingenious brain, were enough to frighten them. The seven\
  \ hundred and fifty grains deposited in very regular furrows were then left for\
  \ nature to do the rest.</p>"
- "<p>On the 21st of November, Cyrus Harding began to plan the canal which was to\
  \ close the plateau on the west, from the south angle of Lake Grant to the angle\
  \ of the Mercy. There was there two or three feet of vegetable earth, and below\
  \ that granite. It was therefore necessary to manufacture some more nitro\u2011\
  glycerine, and the nitro\u2011glycerine did its accustomed work. In less than a\
  \ fortnight a ditch, twelve feet wide and six deep, was dug out in the hard ground\
  \ of the plateau. A new trench was made by the same means in the rocky border of\
  \ the lake, forming a small stream, to which they gave the name of Creek Glycerine,\
  \ and which was thus an affluent of the Mercy. As the engineer had predicted, the\
  \ level of the lake was lowered, though very slightly. To complete the enclosure\
  \ the bed of the stream on the beach was considerably enlarged, and the sand supported\
  \ by means of stakes.</p>"
- <p>By the end of the first fortnight of December these works were finished, and
  Prospect Heights?that is to say, a sort of irregular pentagon, having a perimeter
  of nearly four miles, surrounded by a liquid belt?was completely protected from
  depredators of every description.</p>
- "<p>During the month of December, the heat was very great. In spite of it, however,\
  \ the settlers continued their work, and as they were anxious to possess a poultry\u2011\
  yard they forthwith commenced it.</p>"
- <p>It is useless to say that since the enclosing of the plateau had been completed,
  Master Jup had been set at liberty. He did not leave his masters, and evinced no
  wish to escape. He was a gentle animal, though very powerful and wonderfully active.
  He was already taught to make himself useful by drawing loads of wood and carting
  away the stones which were extracted from the bed of Creek Glycerine.</p>
- "<p>The poultry\u2011yard occupied an area of two hundred square yards, on the southeastern\
  \ bank of the lake. It was surrounded by a palisade, and in it were constructed\
  \ various shelters for the birds which were to populate it. These were simply built\
  \ of branches and divided into compartments, made ready for the expected guests.</p>"
- "<p>The first were the two tinamous, which were not long in having a number of young\
  \ ones; they had for companions half a dozen ducks, accustomed to the borders of\
  \ the lake. Some belonged to the Chinese species, of which the wings open like a\
  \ fan, and which by the brilliancy of their plumage rival the golden pheasants.\
  \ A few days afterwards, Herbert snared a couple of gallinaceae, with spreading\
  \ tails composed of long feathers, magnificent alectors, which soon became tame.\
  \ As to pelicans, kingfishers, water\u2011hens, they came of themselves to the shores\
  \ of the poultry\u2011yard, and this little community, after some disputes, cooing,\
  \ screaming, clucking, ended by settling down peacefully, and increased in encouraging\
  \ proportion for the future use of the colony.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding, wishing to complete his performance, established a pigeon\u2011\
  house in a corner of the poultry\u2011yard. There he lodged a dozen of those pigeons\
  \ which frequented the rocks of the plateau. These birds soon became accustomed\
  \ to returning every evening to their new dwelling, and showed more disposition\
  \ to domesticate themselves than their congeners, the wood\u2011pigeons.</p>"
- "<p>Lastly, the time had come for turning the balloon\u2011case to use, by cutting\
  \ it up to make shirts and other articles; for as to keeping it in its present form,\
  \ and risking themselves in a balloon filled with gas, above a sea of the limits\
  \ of which they had no idea, it was not to be thought of.</p>"
- <p>It was necessary to bring the case to Granite House, and the colonists employed
  themselves in rendering their heavy cart lighter and more manageable. But though
  they had a vehicle, the moving power was yet to be found.</p>
- <p>But did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the place
  of the horse, ass, or ox? That was the question.</p>
- "<p>\u201CCertainly,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Ca beast of burden would be very\
  \ useful to us until the captain has made a steam cart, or even an engine, for some\
  \ day we shall have a railroad from Granite House to Port Balloon, with a branch\
  \ line to Mount Franklin!\u201D</p>"
- <p>One day, the 23rd of December, Neb and Top were heard shouting and barking, each
  apparently trying to see who could make the most noise. The settlers, who were busy
  at the Chimneys, ran, fearing some vexatious incident.</p>
- "<p>What did they see? Two fine animals of a large size that had imprudently ventured\
  \ on the plateau, when the bridges were open. One would have said they were horses,\
  \ or at least donkeys, male and female, of a fine shape, dove\u2011colored, the\
  \ legs and tail white, striped with black on the head and neck. They advanced quietly\
  \ without showing any uneasiness, and gazed at the men, in whom they could not as\
  \ yet recognize their future masters.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThese are onagers!\u201D cried Herbert, \u201Canimals something between\
  \ the zebra and the quagga!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy not donkeys?\u201D asked Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBecause they have not long ears, and their shape is more graceful!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CDonkeys or horses,\u201D interrupted Pencroft, \u201Cthey are ?moving\
  \ powers,\u2019 as the captain would say, and as such must be captured!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The sailor, without frightening the animals, crept through the grass to the bridge
  over Creek Glycerine, lowered it, and the onagers were prisoners.</p>
- "<p>Now, should they seize them with violence and master them by force? No. It was\
  \ decided that for a few days they should be allowed to roam freely about the plateau,\
  \ where there was an abundance of grass, and the engineer immediately began to prepare\
  \ a stable near the poultry\u2011yard, in which the onagers might find food, with\
  \ a good litter, and shelter during the night.</p>"
- "<p>This done, the movements of the two magnificent creatures were left entirely\
  \ free, and the settlers avoided even approaching them so as to terrify them. Several\
  \ times, however, the onagers appeared to wish to leave the plateau, too confined\
  \ for animals accustomed to the plains and forests. They were then seen following\
  \ the water\u2011barrier which everywhere presented itself before them, uttering\
  \ short neighs, then galloping through the grass, and becoming calmer, they would\
  \ remain entire hours gazing at the woods, from which they were cut off for ever!</p>"
- <p>In the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been manufactured, and some days
  after the capture of the onagers, not only the cart was ready, but a straight road,
  or rather a cutting, had been made through the forests of the Far West, from the
  angle of the Mercy to Port Balloon. The cart might then be driven there, and towards
  the end of December they tried the onagers for the first time.</p>
- <p>Pencroft had already coaxed the animals to come and eat out of his hand, and
  they allowed him to approach without making any difficulty, but once harnessed they
  reared and could with difficulty be held in. However, it was not long before they
  submitted to this new service, for the onager, being less refractory than the zebra,
  is frequently put in harness in the mountainous regions of Southern Africa, and
  it has even been acclimatized in Europe, under zones of a relative coolness.</p>
- "<p>On this day all the colony, except Pencroft who walked at the animals\u2019\
  \ heads, mounted the cart, and set out on the road to Port Balloon.</p>"
- <p>Of course they were jolted over the somewhat rough road, but the vehicle arrived
  without any accident, and was soon loaded with the case and rigging of the balloon.</p>
- "<p>At eight o\u2019clock that evening the cart, after passing over the Mercy bridge,\
  \ descended the left bank of the river, and stopped on the beach. The onagers being\
  \ unharnessed, were thence led to their stable, and Pencroft before going to sleep\
  \ gave vent to his feelings in a deep sigh of satisfaction that awoke all the echoes\
  \ of Granite House.</p>"
- <p>Chapter 8</p>
- <p>The first week of January was devoted to the manufacture of the linen garments
  required by the colony. The needles found in the box were used by sturdy if not
  delicate fingers, and we may be sure that what was sewn was sewn firmly.</p>
- "<p>There was no lack of thread, thanks to Cyrus Harding\u2019s idea of re\u2011\
  employing that which had been already used in the covering of the balloon. This\
  \ with admirable patience was all unpicked by Gideon Spilett and Herbert, for Pencroft\
  \ had been obliged to give this work up, as it irritated him beyond measure; but\
  \ he had no equal in the sewing part of the business. Indeed, everybody knows that\
  \ sailors have a remarkable aptitude for tailoring.</p>"
- "<p>The cloth of which the balloon\u2011case was made was then cleaned by means\
  \ of soda and potash, obtained by the incineration of plants, in such a way that\
  \ the cotton, having got rid of the varnish, resumed its natural softness and elasticity;\
  \ then, exposed to the action of the atmosphere, it soon became perfectly white.\
  \ Some dozen shirts and sock?the latter not knitted, of course, but made of cotton?were\
  \ thus manufactured. What a comfort it was to the settlers to clothe themselves\
  \ again in clean linen, which was doubtless rather rough, but they were not troubled\
  \ about that! and then to go to sleep between sheets, which made the couches at\
  \ Granite House into quite comfortable beds!</p>"
- "<p>It was about this time also that they made boots of seal\u2011leather, which\
  \ were greatly needed to replace the shoes and boots brought from America. We may\
  \ be sure that these new shoes were large enough and never pinched the feet of the\
  \ wearers.</p>"
- <p>With the beginning of the year 1866 the heat was very great, but the hunting
  in the forests did not stand still. Agouties, peccaries, capybaras, kangaroos, game
  of all sorts, actually swarmed there, and Spilett and Herbert were too good marksmen
  ever to throw away their shot uselessly.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding still recommended them to husband the ammunition, and he took measures
  to replace the powder and shot which had been found in the box, and which he wished
  to reserve for the future. How did he know where chance might one day cast his companions
  and himself in the event of their leaving their domain? They should, then, prepare
  for the unknown future by husbanding their ammunition and by substituting for it
  some easily renewable substance.</p>
- "<p>To replace lead, of which Harding had found no traces in the island, he employed\
  \ granulated iron, which was easy to manufacture. These bullets, not having the\
  \ weight of leaden bullets, were made larger, and each charge contained less, but\
  \ the skill of the sportsmen made up this deficiency. As to powder, Cyrus Harding\
  \ would have been able to make that also, for he had at his disposal saltpeter,\
  \ sulphur, and coal; but this preparation requires extreme care, and without special\
  \ tools it is difficult to produce it of a good quality. Harding preferred, therefore,\
  \ to manufacture pyroxyle, that is to say gun\u2011cotton, a substance in which\
  \ cotton is not indispensable, as the elementary tissue of vegetables may be used,\
  \ and this is found in an almost pure state, not only in cotton, but in the textile\
  \ fiber of hemp and flax, in paper, the pith of the elder, etc. Now, the elder abounded\
  \ in the island towards the mouth of Red Creek, and the colonists had already made\
  \ coffee of the berries of these shrubs, which belong to the family of the caprifoliaceae.</p>"
- "<p>The only thing to be collected, therefore, was elder\u2011pith, for as to the\
  \ other substance necessary for the manufacture of pyroxyle, it was only fuming\
  \ azotic acid. Now, Harding having sulphuric acid at his disposal, had already been\
  \ easily able to produce azotic acid by attacking the saltpeter with which nature\
  \ supplied him. He accordingly resolved to manufacture and employ pyroxyle, although\
  \ it has some inconveniences, that is to say, a great inequality of effect, an excessive\
  \ inflammability, since it takes fire at one hundred and seventy degrees instead\
  \ of two hundred and forty, and lastly, an instantaneous deflagration which might\
  \ damage the firearms. On the other hand, the advantages of pyroxyle consist in\
  \ this, that it is not injured by damp, that it does not make the gun\u2011barrels\
  \ dirty, and that its force is four times that of ordinary powder.</p>"
- <p>To make pyroxyle, the cotton must be immersed in the fuming azotic acid for a
  quarter of an hour, then washed in cold water and dried. Nothing could be more simple.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding had only at his disposal the ordinary azotic acid and not the fuming
  or monohydrate azotic acid, that is to say, acid which emits white vapors when it
  comes in contact with damp air; but by substituting for the latter ordinary azotic
  acid, mixed, in the proportion of from three to five volumes of concentrated sulphuric
  acid, the engineer obtained the same result. The sportsmen of the island therefore
  soon had a perfectly prepared substance, which, employed discreetly, produced admirable
  results.</p>
- <p>About this time the settlers cleared three acres of the plateau, and the rest
  was preserved in a wild state, for the benefit of the onagers. Several excursions
  were made into the Jacamar Wood and the forests of the Far West, and they brought
  back from thence a large collection of wild vegetables, spinach, cress, radishes,
  and turnips, which careful culture would soon improve, and which would temper the
  regimen on which the settlers had till then subsisted. Supplies of wood and coal
  were also carted. Each excursion was at the same time a means of improving the roads,
  which gradually became smoother under the wheels of the cart.</p>
- "<p>The rabbit\u2011warren still continued to supply the larder of Granite House.\
  \ As fortunately it was situated on the other side of Creek Glycerine, its inhabitants\
  \ could not reach the plateau nor ravage the newly\u2011made plantation. The oyster\u2011\
  bed among the rocks was frequently renewed and furnished excellent molluscs. Besides\
  \ that, the fishing, either in the lake or the Mercy, was very profitable, for Pencroft\
  \ had made some lines, armed with iron hooks, with which they frequently caught\
  \ fine trout, and a species of fish whose silvery sides were speckled with yellow,\
  \ and which were also extremely savory. Master Neb, who was skilled in the culinary\
  \ art, knew how to vary agreeably the bill of fare. Bread alone was wanting at the\
  \ table of the settlers, and as has been said, they felt this privation greatly.</p>"
- "<p>The settlers hunted too the turtles which frequented the shores of Cape Mandible.\
  \ At this place the beach was covered with little mounds, concealing perfectly spherical\
  \ turtles\u2019 eggs, with white hard shells, the albumen of which does not coagulate\
  \ as that of birds\u2019 eggs. They were hatched by the sun, and their number was\
  \ naturally considerable, as each turtle can lay annually two hundred and fifty.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA regular egg\u2011field,\u201D observed Gideon Spilett, \u201Cand we\
  \ have nothing to do but to pick them up.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>But not being contented with simply the produce, they made chase after the producers,\
  \ the result of which was that they were able to bring back to Granite House a dozen\
  \ of these chelonians, which were really valuable from an alimentary point of view.\
  \ The turtle soup, flavored with aromatic herbs, often gained well\u2011merited\
  \ praises for its preparer, Neb.</p>"
- <p>We must here mention another fortunate circumstance by which new stores for the
  winter were laid in. Shoals of salmon entered the Mercy, and ascended the country
  for several miles. It was the time at which the females, going to find suitable
  places in which to spawn, precede the males and make a great noise through the fresh
  water. A thousand of these fish, which measured about two feet and a half in length,
  came up the river, and a large quantity were retained by fixing dams across the
  stream. More than a hundred were thus taken, which were salted and stored for the
  time when winter, freezing up the streams, would render fishing impracticable. By
  this time the intelligent Jup was raised to the duty of valet. He had been dressed
  in a jacket, white linen breeches, and an apron, the pockets of which were his delight.
  The clever orang had been marvelously trained by Neb, and any one would have said
  that the Negro and the ape understood each other when they talked together. Jup
  had besides a real affection for Neb, and Neb returned it. When his services were
  not required, either for carrying wood or for climbing to the top of some tree,
  Jup passed the greatest part of his time in the kitchen, where he endeavored to
  imitate Neb in all that he saw him do. The black showed the greatest patience and
  even extreme zeal in instructing his pupil, and the pupil exhibited remarkable intelligence
  in profiting by the lessons he received from his master.</p>
- <p>Judge then of the pleasure Master Jup gave to the inhabitants of Granite House
  when, without their having had any idea of it, he appeared one day, napkin on his
  arm, ready to wait at table. Quick, attentive, he acquitted himself perfectly, changing
  the plates, bringing dishes, pouring out water, all with a gravity which gave intense
  amusement to the settlers, and which enraptured Pencroft.</p>
- "<p>\u201CJup, some soup!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CJup, a little agouti!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CJup, a plate!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CJup! Good Jup! Honest Jup!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Nothing was heard but that, and Jup without ever being disconcerted, replied
  to every one, watched for everything, and he shook his head in a knowing way when
  Pencroft, referring to his joke of the first day, said to him,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CDecidedly, Jup, your wages must be doubled.\u201D</p>"
- <p>It is useless to say that the orang was now thoroughly domesticated at Granite
  House, and that he often accompanied his masters to the forest without showing any
  wish to leave them. It was most amusing to see him walking with a stick which Pencroft
  had given him, and which he carried on his shoulder like a gun. If they wished to
  gather some fruit from the summit of a tree, how quickly he climbed for it. If the
  wheel of the cart stuck in the mud, with what energy did Jup with a single heave
  of his shoulder put it right again.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat a jolly fellow he is!\u201D cried Pencroft often. \u201CIf he was\
  \ as mischievous as he is good, there would be no doing anything with him!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>It was towards the end of January the colonists began their labors in the center\
  \ of the island. It had been decided that a corral should be established near the\
  \ sources of the Red Creek, at the foot of Mount Franklin, destined to contain the\
  \ ruminants, whose presence would have been troublesome at Granite House, and especially\
  \ for the musmons, who were to supply the wool for the settlers\u2019 winter garments.</p>"
- <p>Each morning, the colony, sometimes entire, but more often represented only by
  Harding, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the sources of the Creek, a distance
  of not more than five miles, by the newly beaten road to which the name of Corral
  Road had been given.</p>
- <p>There a site was chosen, at the back of the southern ridge of the mountain. It
  was a meadow land, dotted here and there with clumps of trees, and watered by a
  little stream, which sprung from the slopes which closed it in on one side. The
  grass was fresh, and it was not too much shaded by the trees which grew about it.
  This meadow was to be surrounded by a palisade, high enough to prevent even the
  most agile animals from leaping over. This enclosure would be large enough to contain
  a hundred musmons and wild goats, with all the young ones they might produce.</p>
- <p>The perimeter of the corral was then traced by the engineer, and they would then
  have proceeded to fell the trees necessary for the construction of the palisade,
  but as the opening up of the road had already necessitated the sacrifice of a considerable
  number, those were brought and supplied a hundred stakes, which were firmly fixed
  in the ground.</p>
- "<p>The construction of this corral did not take less than three weeks, for besides\
  \ the palisade, Cyrus Harding built large sheds, in which the animals could take\
  \ shelter. These buildings had also to be made very strong, for musmons are powerful\
  \ animals, and their first fury was to be feared. The stakes, sharpened at their\
  \ upper end and hardened by fire, had been fixed by means of cross\u2011bars, and\
  \ at regular distances props assured the solidity of the whole.</p>"
- "<p>The corral finished, a raid had to be made on the pastures frequented by the\
  \ ruminants. This was done on the 7th of February, on a beautiful summer\u2019s\
  \ day, and every one took part in it. The onagers, already well trained, were ridden\
  \ by Spilett and Herbert, and were of great use.</p>"
- <p>The maneuver consisted simply in surrounding the musmons and goats, and gradually
  narrowing the circle around them. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, Neb, and Jup, posted
  themselves in different parts of the wood, while the two cavaliers and Top galloped
  in a radius of half a mile round the corral.</p>
- "<p>The musmons were very numerous in this part of the island. These fine animals\
  \ were as large as deer; their horns were stronger than those of the ram, and their\
  \ gray\u2011colored fleece was mixed with long hair.</p>"
- "<p>This hunting day was very fatiguing. Such going and coming, and running and\
  \ riding and shouting! Of a hundred musmons which had been surrounded, more than\
  \ two\u2011thirds escaped, but at last, thirty of these animals and ten wild goats\
  \ were gradually driven back towards the corral, the open door of which appearing\
  \ to offer a means of escape, they rushed in and were prisoners.</p>"
- <p>In short, the result was satisfactory, and the settlers had no reason to complain.
  There was no doubt that the flock would prosper, and that at no distant time not
  only wool but hides would be abundant.</p>
- <p>That evening the hunters returned to Granite House quite exhausted. However,
  notwithstanding their fatigue, they returned the next day to visit the corral. The
  prisoners had been trying to overthrow the palisade, but of course had not succeeded,
  and were not long in becoming more tranquil.</p>
- "<p>During the month of February, no event of any importance occurred. The daily\
  \ labors were pursued methodically, and, as well as improving the roads to the corral\
  \ and to Port Balloon, a third was commenced, which, starting from the enclosure,\
  \ proceeded towards the western coast. The yet unknown portion of Lincoln Island\
  \ was that of the wood\u2011covered Serpentine Peninsula, which sheltered the wild\
  \ beasts, from which Gideon Spilett was so anxious to clear their domain.</p>"
- <p>Before the cold season should appear the most assiduous care was given to the
  cultivation of the wild plants which had been transplanted from the forest to Prospect
  Heights. Herbert never returned from an excursion without bringing home some useful
  vegetable. One day, it was some specimens of the chicory tribe, the seeds of which
  by pressure yield an excellent oil; another, it was some common sorrel, whose antiscorbutic
  qualities were not to be despised; then, some of those precious tubers, which have
  at all times been cultivated in South America, potatoes, of which more than two
  hundred species are now known. The kitchen garden, now well stocked and carefully
  defended from the birds, was divided into small beds, where grew lettuces, kidney
  potatoes, sorrel, turnips, radishes, and other coneiferae. The soil on the plateau
  was particularly fertile, and it was hoped that the harvests would be abundant.</p>
- "<p>They had also a variety of different beverages, and so long as they did not\
  \ demand wine, the most hard to please would have had no reason to complain. To\
  \ the Oswego tea, and the fermented liquor extracted from the roots of the dragonnier,\
  \ Harding had added a regular beer, made from the young shoots of the spruce\u2011\
  fir, which, after having been boiled and fermented, made that agreeable drink called\
  \ by the Anglo\u2011Americans spring\u2011beer.</p>"
- "<p>Towards the end of the summer, the poultry\u2011yard was possessed of a couple\
  \ of fine bustards, which belonged to the houbara species, characterized by a sort\
  \ of feathery mantle; a dozen shovelers, whose upper mandible was prolonged on each\
  \ side by a membraneous appendage; and also some magnificent cocks, similar to the\
  \ Mozambique cocks, the comb, caruncle, and epidermis being black. So far, everything\
  \ had succeeded, thanks to the activity of these courageous and intelligent men.\
  \ Nature did much for them, doubtless; but faithful to the great precept, they made\
  \ a right use of what a bountiful Providence gave them.</p>"
- "<p>After the heat of these warm summer days, in the evening when their work was\
  \ finished and the sea\u2011breeze began to blow, they liked to sit on the edge\
  \ of Prospect Heights, in a sort of veranda, covered with creepers, which Neb had\
  \ made with his own hands. There they talked, they instructed each other, they made\
  \ plans, and the rough good\u2011humor of the sailor always amused this little world,\
  \ in which the most perfect harmony had never ceased to reign.</p>"
- "<p>They often spoke of their country, of their dear and great America. What was\
  \ the result of the War of Secession? It could not have been greatly prolonged.\
  \ Richmond had doubtless soon fallen into the hands of General Grant. The taking\
  \ of the capital of the Confederates must have been the last action of this terrible\
  \ struggle. Now the North had triumphed in the good cause, how welcome would have\
  \ been a newspaper to the exiles in Lincoln Island! For eleven months all communication\
  \ between them and the rest of their fellow\u2011creatures had been interrupted,\
  \ and in a short time the 24th of March would arrive, the anniversary of the day\
  \ on which the balloon had thrown them on this unknown coast. They were then mere\
  \ castaways, not even knowing how they should preserve their miserable lives from\
  \ the fury of the elements! And now, thanks to the knowledge of their captain, and\
  \ their own intelligence, they were regular colonists, furnished with arms, tools,\
  \ and instruments; they had been able to turn to their profit the animals, plants,\
  \ and minerals of the island, that is to say, the three kingdoms of Nature.</p>"
- <p>Yes; they often talked of all these things and formed still more plans.</p>
- "<p>As to Cyrus Harding he was for the most part silent, and listened to his companions\
  \ more often than he spoke to them. Sometimes he smiled at Herbert\u2019s ideas\
  \ or Pencroft\u2019s nonsense, but always and everywhere he pondered over those\
  \ inexplicable facts, that strange enigma, of which the secret still escaped him!</p>"
- <p>Chapter 9</p>
- <p>The weather changed during the first week of March. There had been a full moon
  at the commencement of the month, and the heat was excessive. The atmosphere was
  felt to be full of electricity, and a period of some length of tempestuous weather
  was to be feared.</p>
- "<p>Indeed, on the 2nd, peals of thunder were heard, the wind blew from the east,\
  \ and hail rattled against the facade of Granite House like volleys of grape\u2011\
  shot. The door and windows were immediately closed, or everything in the rooms would\
  \ have been drenched. On seeing these hailstones, some of which were the size of\
  \ a pigeon\u2019s egg, Pencroft\u2019s first thought was that his cornfield was\
  \ in serious danger.</p>"
- <p>He directly rushed to his field, where little green heads were already appearing,
  and by means of a great cloth, he managed to protect his crop.</p>
- <p>This bad weather lasted a week, during which time the thunder rolled without
  cessation in the depths of the sky.</p>
- "<p>The colonists, not having any pressing work out of doors, profited by the bad\
  \ weather to work at the interior of Granite House, the arrangement of which was\
  \ becoming more complete from day to day. The engineer made a turning\u2011lathe,\
  \ with which he turned several articles both for the toilet and the kitchen, particularly\
  \ buttons, the want of which was greatly felt. A gunrack had been made for the firearms,\
  \ which were kept with extreme care, and neither tables nor cupboards were left\
  \ incomplete. They sawed, they planed, they filed, they turned; and during the whole\
  \ of this bad season, nothing was heard but the grinding of tools or the humming\
  \ of the turning\u2011lathe which responded to the growling of the thunder.</p>"
- <p>Master Jup had not been forgotten, and he occupied a room at the back, near the
  storeroom, a sort of cabin with a cot always full of good litter, which perfectly
  suited his taste.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWith good old Jup there is never any quarreling,\u201D often repeated\
  \ Pencroft, \u201Cnever any improper reply. What a servant, Neb, what a servant!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Of course Jup was now well used to service. He brushed their clothes, he turned
  the spit, he waited at table, he swept the rooms, he gathered wood, and he performed
  another admirable piece of service which delighted Pencroft?he never went to sleep
  without first coming to tuck up the worthy sailor in his bed.</p>
- <p>As to the health of the members of the colony, bipeds or bimana, quadrumana or
  quadrupeds, it left nothing to be desired. With their life in the open air, on this
  salubrious soil, under that temperate zone, working both with head and hands, they
  could not suppose that illness would ever attack them.</p>
- <p>All were indeed wonderfully well. Herbert had already grown two inches in the
  year. His figure was forming and becoming more manly, and he promised to be an accomplished
  man, physically as well as morally. Besides he improved himself during the leisure
  hours which manual occupations left to him; he read the books found in the case;
  and after the practical lessons which were taught by the very necessity of their
  position, he found in the engineer for science, and the reporter for languages,
  masters who were delighted to complete his education.</p>
- "<p>The tempest ended about the 9th of March, but the sky remained covered with\
  \ clouds during the whole of this last summer month. The atmosphere, violently agitated\
  \ by the electric commotions, could not recover its former purity, and there was\
  \ almost invariably rain and fog, except for three or four fine days on which several\
  \ excursions were made. About this time the female onager gave birth to a young\
  \ one which belonged to the same sex as its mother, and which throve capitally.\
  \ In the corral, the flock of musmons had also increased, and several lambs already\
  \ bleated in the sheds, to the great delight of Neb and Herbert, who had each their\
  \ favorite among these newcomers. An attempt was also made for the domestication\
  \ of the peccaries, which succeeded well. A sty was constructed under the poultry\u2011\
  yard, and soon contained several young ones in the way to become civilized, that\
  \ is to say, to become fat under Neb\u2019s care. Master Jup, entrusted with carrying\
  \ them their daily nourishment, leavings from the kitchen, etc., acquitted himself\
  \ conscientiously of his task. He sometimes amused himself at the expense of his\
  \ little pensioners by tweaking their tails; but this was mischief, and not wickedness,\
  \ for these little twisted tails amused him like a plaything, and his instinct was\
  \ that of a child. One day in this month of March, Pencroft, talking to the engineer,\
  \ reminded Cyrus Harding of a promise which the latter had not as yet had time to\
  \ fulfil.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou once spoke of an apparatus which would take the place of the long\
  \ ladders at Granite House, captain,\u201D said he; \u201Cwon\u2019t you make it\
  \ some day?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNothing will be easier; but is this a really useful thing?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCertainly, captain. After we have given ourselves necessaries, let us\
  \ think a little of luxury. For us it may be luxury, if you like, but for things\
  \ it is necessary. It isn\u2019t very convenient to climb up a long ladder when\
  \ one is heavily loaded.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, Pencroft, we will try to please you,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut you have no machine at your disposal.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe will make one.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA steam machine?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, a water machine.\u201D</p>"
- <p>And, indeed, to work his apparatus there was already a natural force at the disposal
  of the engineer which could be used without great difficulty. For this, it was enough
  to augment the flow of the little stream which supplied the interior of Granite
  House with water. The opening among the stones and grass was then increased, thus
  producing a strong fall at the bottom of the passage, the overflow from which escaped
  by the inner well. Below this fall the engineer fixed a cylinder with paddles, which
  was joined on the exterior with a strong cable rolled on a wheel, supporting a basket.
  In this way, by means of a long rope reaching to the ground, which enabled them
  to regulate the motive power, they could rise in the basket to the door of Granite
  House.</p>
- "<p>It was on the 17th of March that the lift acted for the first time, and gave\
  \ universal satisfaction. Henceforward all the loads, wood, coal, provisions, and\
  \ even the settlers themselves, were hoisted by this simple system, which replaced\
  \ the primitive ladder, and, as may be supposed, no one thought of regretting the\
  \ change. Top particularly was enchanted with this improvement, for he had not,\
  \ and never could have possessed Master Jup\u2019s skill in climbing ladders, and\
  \ often it was on Neb\u2019s back, or even on that of the orang that he had been\
  \ obliged to make the ascent to Granite House. About this time, too, Cyrus Harding\
  \ attempted to manufacture glass, and he at first put the old pottery\u2011kiln\
  \ to this new use. There were some difficulties to be encountered; but, after several\
  \ fruitless attempts, he succeeded in setting up a glass manufactory, which Gideon\
  \ Spilett and Herbert, his usual assistants, did not leave for several days. As\
  \ to the substances used in the composition of glass, they are simply sand, chalk,\
  \ and soda, either carbonate or sulphate. Now the beach supplied sand, lime supplied\
  \ chalk, sea\u2011weeds supplied soda, pyrites supplied sulphuric acid, and the\
  \ ground supplied coal to heat the kiln to the wished\u2011for temperature. Cyrus\
  \ Harding thus soon had everything ready for setting to work.</p>"
- "<p>The tool, the manufacture of which presented the most difficulty, was the pipe\
  \ of the glass\u2011maker, an iron tube, five or six feet long, which collects on\
  \ one end the material in a state of fusion. But by means of a long, thin piece\
  \ of iron rolled up like the barrel of a gun, Pencroft succeeded in making a tube\
  \ soon ready for use.</p>"
- "<p>On the 28th of March the tube was heated. A hundred parts of sand, thirty\u2011\
  five of chalk, forty of sulphate of soda, mixed with two or three parts of powdered\
  \ coal, composed the substance, which was placed in crucibles. When the high temperature\
  \ of the oven had reduced it to a liquid, or rather a pasty state, Cyrus Harding\
  \ collected with the tube a quantity of the paste: he turned it about on a metal\
  \ plate, previously arranged, so as to give it a form suitable for blowing, then\
  \ he passed the tube to Herbert, telling him to blow at the other extremity.</p>"
- "<p>And Herbert, swelling out his cheeks, blew so much and so well into the tube\u2011\
  taking care to twirl it round at the same time?that his breath dilated the glassy\
  \ mass. Other quantities of the substance in a state of fusion were added to the\
  \ first, and in a short time the result was a bubble which measured a foot in diameter.\
  \ Harding then took the tube out of Herbert\u2019s hands, and, giving it a pendulous\
  \ motion, he ended by lengthening the malleable bubble so as to give it a cylindroconic\
  \ shape.</p>"
- <p>The blowing operation had given a cylinder of glass terminated by two hemispheric
  caps, which were easily detached by means of a sharp iron dipped in cold water;
  then, by the same proceeding, this cylinder was cut lengthways, and after having
  been rendered malleable by a second heating, it was extended on a plate and spread
  out with a wooden roller.</p>
- <p>The first pane was thus manufactured, and they had only to perform this operation
  fifty times to have fifty panes. The windows at Granite House were soon furnished
  with panes; not very white, perhaps, but still sufficiently transparent.</p>
- "<p>As to bottles and tumblers, that was only play. They were satisfied with them,\
  \ besides, just as they came from the end of the tube. Pencroft had asked to be\
  \ allowed to \u201Cblow\u201D in his turn, and it was great fun for him; but he\
  \ blew so hard that his productions took the most ridiculous shapes, which he admired\
  \ immensely.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding and Herbert, while hunting one day, had entered the forest of\
  \ the Far West, on the left bank of the Mercy, and, as usual, the lad was asking\
  \ a thousand questions of the engineer, who answered them heartily. Now, as Harding\
  \ was not a sportsman, and as, on the other side, Herbert was talking chemistry\
  \ and natural philosophy, numbers of kangaroos, capybaras, and agouties came within\
  \ range, which, however, escaped the lad\u2019s gun; the consequence was that the\
  \ day was already advanced, and the two hunters were in danger of having made a\
  \ useless excursion, when Herbert, stopping, and uttering a cry of joy, exclaimed,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh, Captain Harding, do you see that tree?\u201D and he pointed to a shrub,\
  \ rather than a tree, for it was composed of a single stem, covered with a scaly\
  \ bark, which bore leaves streaked with little parallel veins.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd what is this tree which resembles a little palm?\u201D asked Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is a ?cycas revoluta,\u2019 of which I have a picture in our dictionary\
  \ of Natural History!\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut I can\u2019t see any fruit on this shrub!\u201D observed his companion.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, captain,\u201D replied Herbert; \u201Cbut its stem contains a flour\
  \ with which nature has provided us all ready ground.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is, then, the bread\u2011tree?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, the bread\u2011tree.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, my boy,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cthis is a valuable discovery,\
  \ since our wheat harvest is not yet ripe; I hope that you are not mistaken!\u201D\
  </p>"
- '<p>Herbert was not mistaken: he broke the stem of a cycas, which was composed of
  a glandulous tissue, containing a quantity of floury pith, traversed with woody
  fiber, separated by rings of the same substance, arranged concentrically. With this
  fecula was mingled a mucilaginous juice of disagreeable flavor, but which it would
  be easy to get rid of by pressure. This cellular substance was regular flour of
  a superior quality, extremely nourishing; its exportation was formerly forbidden
  by the Japanese laws.</p>'
- <p>Cyrus Harding and Herbert, after having examined that part of the Far West where
  the cycas grew, took their bearings, and returned to Granite House, where they made
  known their discovery.</p>
- <p>The next day the settlers went to collect some, and returned to Granite House
  with an ample supply of cycas stems. The engineer constructed a press, with which
  to extract the mucilaginous juice mingled with the fecula, and he obtained a large
  quantity of flour, which Neb soon transformed into cakes and puddings. This was
  not quite real wheaten bread, but it was very like it.</p>
- "<p>Now, too, the onager, the goats, and the sheep in the corral furnished daily\
  \ the milk necessary to the colony. The cart, or rather a sort of light carriole\
  \ which had replaced it, made frequent journeys to the corral, and when it was Pencroft\u2019\
  s turn to go he took Jup, and let him drive, and Jup, cracking his whip, acquitted\
  \ himself with his customary intelligence.</p>"
- <p>Everything prospered, as well in the corral as in Granite House, and certainly
  the settlers, if it had not been that they were so far from their native land, had
  no reason to complain. They were so well suited to this life, and were, besides,
  so accustomed to the island, that they could not have left its hospitable soil without
  regret!</p>
- <p>And yet so deeply is the love of his country implanted in the heart of man, that
  if a ship had unexpectedly come in sight of the island, the colonists would have
  made signals, would have attracted her attention, and would have departed!</p>
- <p>It was the 1st of April, a Sunday, Easter Day, which Harding and his companions
  sanctified by rest and prayer. The day was fine, such as an October day in the Northern
  Hemisphere might be.</p>
- "<p>All, towards the evening after dinner, were seated under the veranda on the\
  \ edge of Prospect Heights, and they were watching the darkness creeping up from\
  \ the horizon. Some cups of the infusion of elder\u2011berries, which took the place\
  \ of coffee, had been served by Neb. They were speaking of the island and of its\
  \ isolated situation in the Pacific, which led Gideon Spilett to say,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy dear Cyrus, have you ever, since you possessed the sextant found in\
  \ the case, again taken the position of our island?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut it would perhaps be a good thing to do it with this instrument, which\
  \ is more perfect than that which you before used.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is the good?\u201D said Pencroft. \u201CThe island is quite comfortable\
  \ where it is!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, who knows,\u201D returned the reporter, \u201Cwho knows but that\
  \ we may be much nearer inhabited land than we think?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall know to\u2011morrow,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cand if\
  \ it had not been for the occupations which left me no leisure, we should have known\
  \ it already.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGood!\u201D said Pencroft. \u201CThe captain is too good an observer to\
  \ be mistaken, and, if it has not moved from its place, the island is just where\
  \ he put it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall see.\u201D</p>"
- <p>On the next day, therefore, by means of the sextant, the engineer made the necessary
  observations to verify the position which he had already obtained, and this was
  the result of his operation. His first observation had given him the situation of
  Lincoln Island,?</p>
- '<p>In west longitude: from 150 to 155;</p>'
- '<p>In south latitude: from 30 to 35</p>'
- <p>  The second gave exactly:</p>
- "<p>In longitude: 150 30\u2019</p>"
- "<p>In south latitude: 34 57\u2019</p>"
- <p>So then, notwithstanding the imperfection of his apparatus, Cyrus Harding had
  operated with so much skill that his error did not exceed five degrees.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNow,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Csince we possess an atlas as well\
  \ as a sextant, let us see, my dear Cyrus, the exact position which Lincoln Island\
  \ occupies in the Pacific.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Herbert fetched the atlas, and the map of the Pacific was opened, and the engineer,
  compass in hand, prepared to determine their position.</p>
- <p>Suddenly the compasses stopped, and he exclaimed,</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut an island exists in this part of the Pacific already!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAn island?\u201D cried Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTabor Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAn important island?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, an islet lost in the Pacific, and which perhaps has never been visited.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, we will visit it,\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, captain. We will build a decked boat, and I will undertake to steer\
  \ her. At what distance are we from this Tabor Island?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAbout a hundred and fifty miles to the northeast,\u201D replied Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA hundred and fifty miles! And what\u2019s that?\u201D returned Pencroft.\
  \ \u201CIn forty\u2011eight hours, with a good wind, we should sight it!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And, on this reply, it was decided that a vessel should be constructed in time
  to be launched towards the month of next October, on the return of the fine season.</p>
- <p>Chapter 10</p>
- <p>When Pencroft had once got a plan in his head, he had no peace till it was executed.
  Now he wished to visit Tabor Island, and as a boat of a certain size was necessary
  for this voyage, he determined to build one.</p>
- <p>What wood should he employ? Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the island?
  They decided for the fir, as being easy to work, but which stands water as well
  as the elm.</p>
- <p>These details settled, it was agreed that since the fine season would not return
  before six months, Cyrus Harding and Pencroft should work alone at the boat. Gideon
  Spilett and Herbert were to continue to hunt, and neither Neb nor Master Jup, his
  assistant, were to leave the domestic duties which had devolved upon them.</p>
- "<p>Directly the trees were chosen, they were felled, stripped of their branches,\
  \ and sawn into planks as well as sawyers would have been able to do it. A week\
  \ after, in the recess between the Chimneys and the cliff, a dockyard was prepared,\
  \ and a keel five\u2011and\u2011thirty feet long, furnished with a stern\u2011post\
  \ at the stern and a stem at the bows, lay along the sand.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding was not working in the dark at this new trade. He knew as much\
  \ about ship\u2011building as about nearly everything else, and he had at first\
  \ drawn the model of his ship on paper. Besides, he was ably seconded by Pencroft,\
  \ who, having worked for several years in a dockyard in Brooklyn, knew the practical\
  \ part of the trade. It was not until after careful calculation and deep thought\
  \ that the timbers were laid on the keel.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft, as may be believed, was all eagerness to carry out his new enterprise,
  and would not leave his work for an instant.</p>
- "<p>A single thing had the honor of drawing him, but for one day only, from his\
  \ dockyard. This was the second wheat\u2011harvest, which was gathered in on the\
  \ 15th of April. It was as much a success as the first, and yielded the number of\
  \ grains which had been predicted.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFive bushels, captain,\u201D said Pencroft, after having scrupulously\
  \ measured his treasure.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFive bushels,\u201D replied the engineer; \u201Cand a hundred and thirty\
  \ thousand grains a bushel will make six hundred and fifty thousand grains.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, we will sow them all this time,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cexcept\
  \ a little in reserve.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Pencroft, and if the next crop gives a proportionate yield, we shall\
  \ have four thousand bushels.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd shall we eat bread?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall eat bread.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut we must have a mill.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe will make one.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The third corn\u2011field was very much larger than the two first, and the soil,\
  \ prepared with extreme care, received the precious seed. That done, Pencroft returned\
  \ to his work.</p>"
- "<p>During this time Spilett and Herbert hunted in the neighborhood, and they ventured\
  \ deep into the still unknown parts of the Far West, their guns loaded with ball,\
  \ ready for any dangerous emergency. It was a vast thicket of magnificent trees,\
  \ crowded together as if pressed for room. The exploration of these dense masses\
  \ of wood was difficult in the extreme, and the reporter never ventured there without\
  \ the pocket\u2011compass, for the sun scarcely pierced through the thick foliage\
  \ and it would have been very difficult for them to retrace their way. It naturally\
  \ happened that game was more rare in those situations where there was hardly sufficient\
  \ room to move; two or three large herbivorous animals were however killed during\
  \ the last fortnight of April. These were koalas, specimens of which the settlers\
  \ had already seen to the north of the lake, and which stupidly allowed themselves\
  \ to be killed among the thick branches of the trees in which they took refuge.\
  \ Their skins were brought back to Granite House, and there, by the help of sulphuric\
  \ acid, they were subjected to a sort of tanning process which rendered them capable\
  \ of being used.</p>"
- "<p>On the 30th of April, the two sportsmen were in the depth of the Far West, when\
  \ the reporter, preceding Herbert a few paces, arrived in a sort of clearing, into\
  \ which the trees more sparsely scattered had permitted a few rays to penetrate.\
  \ Gideon Spilett was at first surprised at the odor which exhaled from certain plants\
  \ with straight stalks, round and branchy, bearing grape\u2011like clusters of flowers\
  \ and very small berries. The reporter broke off one or two of these stalks and\
  \ returned to the lad, to whom he said,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat can this be, Herbert?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, Mr. Spilett,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cthis is a treasure which\
  \ will secure you Pencroft\u2019s gratitude forever.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIs it tobacco?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, and though it may not be of the first quality, it is none the less\
  \ tobacco!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh, good old Pencroft! Won\u2019t he be pleased! But we must not let him\
  \ smoke it all, he must give us our share.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh! an idea occurs to me, Mr. Spilett,\u201D replied Herbert. \u201CDon\u2019\
  t let us say anything to Pencroft yet; we will prepare these leaves, and one fine\
  \ day we will present him with a pipe already filled!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAll right, Herbert, and on that day our worthy companion will have nothing\
  \ left to wish for in this world.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The reporter and the lad secured a good store of the precious plant, and then\
  \ returned to Granite House, where they smuggled it in with as much precaution as\
  \ if Pencroft had been the most vigilant and severe of custom\u2011house officers.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding and Neb were taken into confidence, and the sailor suspected nothing
  during the whole time, necessarily somewhat long, which was required in order to
  dry the small leaves, chop them up, and subject them to a certain torrefaction on
  hot stones. This took two months; but all these manipulations were successfully
  carried on unknown to Pencroft, for, occupied with the construction of his boat,
  he only returned to Granite House at the hour of rest.</p>
- "<p>For some days they had observed an enormous animal two or three miles out in\
  \ the open sea swimming around Lincoln Island. This was a whale of the largest size,\
  \ which apparently belonged to the southern species, called the \u201CCape Whale.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat a lucky chance it would be if we could capture it!\u201D cried the\
  \ sailor. \u201CAh! if we only had a proper boat and a good harpoon, I would say\
  \ ?After the beast,\u2019 for he would be well worth the trouble of catching!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, Pencroft,\u201D observed Harding, \u201CI should much like to watch\
  \ you handling a harpoon. It would be very interesting.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am astonished,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cto see a whale in this\
  \ comparatively high latitude.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy so, Mr. Spilett?\u201D replied Herbert. \u201CWe are exactly in that\
  \ part of the Pacific which English and American whalemen call the whale field,\
  \ and it is here, between New Zealand and South America, that the whales of the\
  \ Southern Hemisphere are met with in the greatest numbers.\u201D</p>"
- <p>And Pencroft returned to his work, not without uttering a sigh of regret, for
  every sailor is a born fisherman, and if the pleasure of fishing is in exact proportion
  to the size of the animal, one can judge how a whaler feels in sight of a whale.
  And if this had only been for pleasure! But they could not help feeling how valuable
  such a prize would have been to the colony, for the oil, fat, and bones would have
  been put to many uses.</p>
- "<p>Now it happened that this whale appeared to have no wish to leave the waters\
  \ of the island. Therefore, whether from the windows of Granite House, or from Prospect\
  \ Heights, Herbert and Gideon Spilett, when they were not hunting, or Neb, unless\
  \ presiding over his fires, never left the telescope, but watched all the animal\u2019\
  s movements. The cetacean, having entered far into Union Bay, made rapid furrows\
  \ across it from Mandible Cape to Claw Cape, propelled by its enormously powerful\
  \ flukes, on which it supported itself, and making its way through the water at\
  \ the rate little short of twelve knots. Sometimes also it approached so near to\
  \ the island that it could be clearly distinguished. It was the southern whale,\
  \ which is completely black, the head being more depressed than that of the northern\
  \ whale.</p>"
- "<p>They could also see it throwing up from its air\u2011holes to a great height\
  \ a cloud of vapor, or of water, for, strange as it may appear, naturalists and\
  \ whalers are not agreed on this subject. Is it air or is it water which is thus\
  \ driven out? It is generally admitted to be vapor, which, condensing suddenly by\
  \ contact with the cold air, falls again as rain.</p>"
- <p>However, the presence of this mammifer preoccupied the colonists. It irritated
  Pencroft especially, as he could think of nothing else while at work. He ended by
  longing for it, like a child for a thing which it has been denied. At night he talked
  about it in his sleep, and certainly if he had had the means of attacking it, if
  the sloop had been in a fit state to put to sea, he would not have hesitated to
  set out in pursuit.</p>
- <p>But what the colonists could not do for themselves chance did for them, and on
  the 3rd of May shouts from Neb, who had stationed himself at the kitchen window,
  announced that the whale was stranded on the beach of the island.</p>
- <p>Herbert and Gideon Spilett, who were just about to set out hunting, left their
  guns, Pencroft threw down his ax, and Harding and Neb joining their companions,
  all rushed towards the scene of action.</p>
- "<p>The stranding had taken place on the beach of Flotsam Point, three miles from\
  \ Granite House, and at high tide. It was therefore probable that the cetacean would\
  \ not be able to extricate itself easily; at any rate it was best to hasten, so\
  \ as to cut off its retreat if necessary. They ran with pick\u2011axes and iron\u2011\
  tipped poles in their hands, passed over the Mercy bridge, descended the right bank\
  \ of the river, along the beach, and in less than twenty minutes the settlers were\
  \ close to the enormous animal, above which flocks of birds already hovered.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat a monster!\u201D cried Neb.</p>"
- <p>And the exclamation was natural, for it was a southern whale, eighty feet long,
  a giant of the species, probably not weighing less than a hundred and fifty thousand
  pounds!</p>
- <p>In the meanwhile, the monster thus stranded did not move, nor attempt by struggling
  to regain the water while the tide was still high.</p>
- <p>It was dead, and a harpoon was sticking out of its left side.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThere are whalers in these quarters, then?\u201D said Gideon Spilett directly.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh, Mr. Spilett, that doesn\u2019t prove anything!\u201D replied Pencroft.\
  \ \u201CWhales have been known to go thousands of miles with a harpoon in the side,\
  \ and this one might even have been struck in the north of the Atlantic and come\
  \ to die in the south of the Pacific, and it would be nothing astonishing.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>Pencroft, having torn the harpoon from the animal\u2019s side, read this inscription\
  \ on it:</p>"
- <p>           MARIA STELLA, VINEYARD</p>
- "<p>\u201CA vessel from the Vineyard! A ship from my country!\u201D he cried. \u201C\
  The ?Maria Stella!\u2019 A fine whaler, ?pon my word; I know her well! Oh, my friends,\
  \ a vessel from the Vineyard!?a whaler from the Vineyard!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And the sailor brandishing the harpoon, repeated, not without emotion, the name
  which he loved so well?the name of his birthplace.</p>
- "<p>But as it could not be expected that the \u201CMaria Stella\u201D would come\
  \ to reclaim the animal harpooned by her, they resolved to begin cutting it up before\
  \ decomposition should commence. The birds, who had watched this rich prey for several\
  \ days, had determined to take possession of it without further delay, and it was\
  \ necessary to drive them off by firing at them repeatedly.</p>"
- "<p>The whale was a female, and a large quantity of milk was taken from it, which,\
  \ according to the opinion of the naturalist Duffenbach, might pass for cow\u2019\
  s milk, and, indeed, it differs from it neither in taste, color, nor density.</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft had formerly served on board a whaling\u2011ship, and he could methodically\
  \ direct the operation of cutting up, a sufficiently disagreeable operation lasting\
  \ three days, but from which the settlers did not flinch, not even Gideon Spilett,\
  \ who, as the sailor said, would end by making a \u201Creal good castaway.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The blubber, cut in parallel slices of two feet and a half in thickness, then
  divided into pieces which might weigh about a thousand pounds each, was melted down
  in large earthen pots brought to the spot, for they did not wish to taint the environs
  of Granite House, and in this fusion it lost nearly a third of its weight.</p>
- <p>But there was an immense quantity of it; the tongue alone yielded six thousand
  pounds of oil, and the lower lip four thousand. Then, besides the fat, which would
  insure for a long time a store of stearine and glycerine, there were still the bones,
  for which a use could doubtless be found, although there were neither umbrellas
  nor stays used at Granite House. The upper part of the mouth of the cetacean was,
  indeed, provided on both sides with eight hundred horny blades, very elastic, of
  a fibrous texture, and fringed at the edge like great combs, at which the teeth,
  six feet long, served to retain the thousands of animalculae, little fish, and molluscs,
  on which the whale fed.</p>
- <p>The operation finished, to the great satisfaction of the operators, the remains
  of the animal were left to the birds, who would soon make every vestige of it disappear,
  and their usual daily occupations were resumed by the inmates of Granite House.</p>
- "<p>However, before returning to the dockyard, Cyrus Harding conceived the idea\
  \ of fabricating certain machines, which greatly excited the curiosity of his companions.\
  \ He took a dozen of the whale\u2019s bones, cut them into six equal parts, and\
  \ sharpened their ends.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis machine is not my own invention, and it is frequently employed by\
  \ the Aleutian hunters in Russian America. You see these bones, my friends; well,\
  \ when it freezes, I will bend them, and then wet them with water till they are\
  \ entirely covered with ice, which will keep them bent, and I will strew them on\
  \ the snow, having previously covered them with fat. Now, what will happen if a\
  \ hungry animal swallows one of these baits? Why, the heat of his stomach will melt\
  \ the ice, and the bone, springing straight, will pierce him with its sharp points.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell! I do call that ingenious!\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd it will spare the powder and shot,\u201D rejoined Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat will be better than traps!\u201D added Neb.</p>"
- "<p>In the meanwhile the boat\u2011building progressed, and towards the end of the\
  \ month half the planking was completed. It could already be seen that her shape\
  \ was excellent, and that she would sail well.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft worked with unparalleled ardor, and only a sturdy frame could have borne
  such fatigue; but his companions were preparing in secret a reward for his labors,
  and on the 31st of May he was to meet with one of the greatest joys of his life.</p>
- <p>On that day, after dinner, just as he was about to leave the table, Pencroft
  felt a hand on his shoulder.</p>
- <p>It was the hand of Gideon Spilett, who said,?</p>
- "<p>\u201COne moment, Master Pencroft, you mustn\u2019t sneak off like that! You\u2019\
  ve forgotten your dessert.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThank you, Mr. Spilett,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201CI am going back\
  \ to my work.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, a cup of coffee, my friend?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNothing more.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA pipe, then?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft jumped up, and his great good\u2011natured face grew pale when he saw\
  \ the reporter presenting him with a ready\u2011filled pipe, and Herbert with a\
  \ glowing coal.</p>"
- <p>The sailor endeavored to speak, but could not get out a word; so, seizing the
  pipe, he carried it to his lips, then applying the coal, he drew five or six great
  whiffs. A fragrant blue cloud soon arose, and from its depths a voice was heard
  repeating excitedly,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CTobacco! real tobacco!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Pencroft,\u201D returned Cyrus Harding, \u201Cand very good tobacco\
  \ too!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CO, divine Providence; sacred Author of all things!\u201D cried the sailor.\
  \ \u201CNothing more is now wanting to our island.\u201D</p>"
- <p>And Pencroft smoked, and smoked, and smoked.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAnd who made this discovery?\u201D he asked at length. \u201CYou, Herbert,\
  \ no doubt?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Pencroft, it was Mr. Spilett.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMr. Spilett!\u201D exclaimed the sailor, seizing the reporter, and clasping\
  \ him to his breast with such a squeeze that he had never felt anything like it\
  \ before.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh Pencroft,\u201D said Spilett, recovering his breath at last, \u201C\
  a truce for one moment. You must share your gratitude with Herbert, who recognized\
  \ the plant, with Cyrus, who prepared it, and with Neb, who took a great deal of\
  \ trouble to keep our secret.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, my friends, I will repay you some day,\u201D replied the sailor.\
  \ \u201CNow we are friends for life.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 11</p>
- <p>Winter arrived with the month of June, which is the December of the northern
  zones, and the great business was the making of warm and solid clothing.</p>
- <p>The musmons in the corral had been stripped of their wool, and this precious
  textile material was now to be transformed into stuff.</p>
- "<p>Of course Cyrus Harding, having at his disposal neither carders, combers, polishers,\
  \ stretchers, twisters, mule\u2011jenny, nor self\u2011acting machine to spin the\
  \ wool, nor loom to weave it, was obliged to proceed in a simpler way, so as to\
  \ do without spinning and weaving. And indeed he proposed to make use of the property\
  \ which the filaments of wool possess when subjected to a powerful pressure of mixing\
  \ together, and of manufacturing by this simple process the material called felt.\
  \ This felt could then be obtained by a simple operation which, if it diminished\
  \ the flexibility of the stuff, increased its power of retaining heat in proportion.\
  \ Now the wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very short hairs, and was\
  \ in a good condition to be felted.</p>"
- "<p>The engineer, aided by his companions, including Pencroft, who was once more\
  \ obliged to leave his boat, commenced the preliminary operations, the subject of\
  \ which was to rid the wool of that fat and oily substance with which it is impregnated,\
  \ and which is called grease. This cleaning was done in vats filled with water,\
  \ which was maintained at the temperature of seventy degrees, and in which the wool\
  \ was soaked for four\u2011and\u2011twenty hours; it was then thoroughly washed\
  \ in baths of soda, and, when sufficiently dried by pressure, it was in a state\
  \ to be compressed, that is to say, to produce a solid material, rough, no doubt,\
  \ and such as would have no value in a manufacturing center of Europe or America,\
  \ but which would be highly esteemed in the Lincoln Island markets.</p>"
- "<p>This sort of material must have been known from the most ancient times, and,\
  \ in fact, the first woolen stuffs were manufactured by the process which Harding\
  \ was now about to employ. Where Harding\u2019s engineering qualifications now came\
  \ into play was in the construction of the machine for pressing the wool; for he\
  \ knew how to turn ingeniously to profit the mechanical force, hitherto unused,\
  \ which the waterfall on the beach possessed to move a fulling\u2011mill.</p>"
- <p>Nothing could be more rudimentary. The wool was placed in troughs, and upon it
  fell in turns heavy wooden mallets; such was the machine in question, and such it
  had been for centuries until the time when the mallets were replaced by cylinders
  of compression, and the material was no longer subjected to beating, but to regular
  rolling.</p>
- "<p>The operation, ably directed by Cyrus Harding, was a complete success. The wool,\
  \ previously impregnated with a solution of soap, intended on the one hand to facilitate\
  \ the interlacing, the compression, and the softening of the wool, and on the other\
  \ to prevent its diminution by the beating, issued from the mill in the shape of\
  \ thick felt cloth. The roughnesses with which the staple of wool is naturally filled\
  \ were so thoroughly entangled and interlaced together that a material was formed\
  \ equally suitable either for garments or bedclothes. It was certainly neither merino,\
  \ muslin, cashmere, rep, satin, alpaca, cloth, nor flannel. It was \u201CLincolnian\
  \ felt,\u201D and Lincoln Island possessed yet another manufacture. The colonists\
  \ had now warm garments and thick bedclothes, and they could without fear await\
  \ the approach of the winter of 1866\u201167.</p>"
- "<p>The severe cold began to be felt about the 20th of June, and, to his great regret,\
  \ Pencroft was obliged to suspend his boat\u2011building, which he hoped to finish\
  \ in time for next spring.</p>"
- "<p>The sailor\u2019s great idea was to make a voyage of discovery to Tabor Island,\
  \ although Harding could not approve of a voyage simply for curiosity\u2019s sake,\
  \ for there was evidently nothing to be found on this desert and almost arid rock.\
  \ A voyage of a hundred and fifty miles in a comparatively small vessel, over unknown\
  \ seas, could not but cause him some anxiety. Suppose that their vessel, once out\
  \ at sea, should be unable to reach Tabor Island, and could not return to Lincoln\
  \ Island, what would become of her in the midst of the Pacific, so fruitful of disasters?</p>"
- <p>Harding often talked over this project with Pencroft, and he found him strangely
  bent upon undertaking this voyage, for which determination he himself could give
  no sufficient reason.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNow,\u201D said the engineer one day to him, \u201CI must observe, my\
  \ friend, that after having said so much, in praise of Lincoln Island, after having\
  \ spoken so often of the sorrow you would feel if you were obliged to forsake it,\
  \ you are the first to wish to leave it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COnly to leave it for a few days,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Conly for\
  \ a few days, captain. Time to go and come back, and see what that islet is like!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut it is not nearly as good as Lincoln Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI know that beforehand.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen why venture there?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo know what is going on in Tabor Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut nothing is going on there; nothing could happen there.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho knows?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd if you are caught in a hurricane?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere is no fear of that in the fine season,\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201C\
  But, captain, as we must provide against everything, I shall ask your permission\
  \ to take Herbert only with me on this voyage.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPencroft,\u201D replied the engineer, placing his hand on the sailor\u2019\
  s shoulder, \u201Cif any misfortune happens to you, or to this lad, whom chance\
  \ has made our child, do you think we could ever cease to blame ourselves?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Harding,\u201D replied Pencroft, with unshaken confidence, \u201C\
  we shall not cause you that sorrow. Besides, we will speak further of this voyage,\
  \ when the time comes to make it. And I fancy, when you have seen our tight\u2011\
  rigged little craft, when you have observed how she behaves at sea, when we sail\
  \ round our island, for we will do so together?I fancy, I say, that you will no\
  \ longer hesitate to let me go. I don\u2019t conceal from you that your boat will\
  \ be a masterpiece.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSay ?our\u2019 boat, at least, Pencroft,\u201D replied the engineer, disarmed\
  \ for the moment. The conversation ended thus, to be resumed later on, without convincing\
  \ either the sailor or the engineer.</p>"
- <p>The first snow fell towards the end of the month of June. The corral had previously
  been largely supplied with stores, so that daily visits to it were not requisite;
  but it was decided that more than a week should never be allowed to pass without
  someone going to it.</p>
- <p>Traps were again set, and the machines manufactured by Harding were tried. The
  bent whalebones, imprisoned in a case of ice, and covered with a thick outer layer
  of fat, were placed on the border of the forest at a spot where animals usually
  passed on their way to the lake.</p>
- "<p>To the engineer\u2019s great satisfaction, this invention, copied from the Aleutian\
  \ fishermen, succeeded perfectly. A dozen foxes, a few wild boars, and even a jaguar,\
  \ were taken in this way, the animals being found dead, their stomachs pierced by\
  \ the unbent bones.</p>"
- <p>An incident must here be related, not only as interesting in itself, but because
  it was the first attempt made by the colonists to communicate with the rest of mankind.</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett had already several times pondered whether to throw into the sea
  a letter enclosed in a bottle, which currents might perhaps carry to an inhabited
  coast, or to confide it to pigeons.</p>
- <p>But how could it be seriously hoped that either pigeons or bottles could cross
  the distance of twelve hundred miles which separated the island from any inhabited
  land? It would have been pure folly.</p>
- "<p>But on the 30th of June the capture was effected, not without difficulty, of\
  \ an albatross, which a shot from Herbert\u2019s gun had slightly wounded in the\
  \ foot. It was a magnificent bird, measuring ten feet from wing to wing, and which\
  \ could traverse seas as wide as the Pacific.</p>"
- <p>Herbert would have liked to keep this superb bird, as its wound would soon heal,
  and he thought he could tame it; but Spilett explained to him that they should not
  neglect this opportunity of attempting to communicate by this messenger with the
  lands of the Pacific; for if the albatross had come from some inhabited region,
  there was no doubt but that it would return there so soon as it was set free.</p>
- <p>Perhaps in his heart Gideon Spilett, in whom the journalist sometimes came to
  the surface, was not sorry to have the opportunity of sending forth to take its
  chance an exciting article relating the adventures of the settlers in Lincoln Island.
  What a success for the authorized reporter of the New York Herald, and for the number
  which should contain the article, if it should ever reach the address of its editor,
  the Honorable James Bennett!</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett then wrote out a concise account, which was placed in a strong
  waterproof bag, with an earnest request to whoever might find it to forward it to
  the office of the New York Herald. This little bag was fastened to the neck of the
  albatross, and not to its foot, for these birds are in the habit of resting on the
  surface of the sea; then liberty was given to this swift courier of the air, and
  it was not without some emotion that the colonists watched it disappear in the misty
  west.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhere is he going to?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTowards New Zealand,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA good voyage to you,\u201D shouted the sailor, who himself did not expect\
  \ any great result from this mode of correspondence.</p>"
- "<p>With the winter, work had been resumed in the interior of Granite House, mending\
  \ clothes and different occupations, among others making the sails for their vessel,\
  \ which were cut from the inexhaustible balloon\u2011case.</p>"
- "<p>During the month of July the cold was intense, but there was no lack of either\
  \ wood or coal. Cyrus Harding had established a second fireplace in the dining\u2011\
  room, and there the long winter evenings were spent. Talking while they worked,\
  \ reading when the hands remained idle, the time passed with profit to all.</p>"
- "<p>It was real enjoyment to the settlers when in their room, well lighted with\
  \ candles, well warmed with coal, after a good dinner, elderberry coffee smoking\
  \ in the cups, the pipes giving forth an odoriferous smoke, they could hear the\
  \ storm howling without. Their comfort would have been complete, if complete comfort\
  \ could ever exist for those who are far from their fellow\u2011creatures, and without\
  \ any means of communication with them. They often talked of their country, of the\
  \ friends whom they had left, of the grandeur of the American Republic, whose influence\
  \ could not but increase; and Cyrus Harding, who had been much mixed up with the\
  \ affairs of the Union, greatly interested his auditors by his recitals, his views,\
  \ and his prognostics.</p>"
- <p>It chanced one day that Spilett was led to say?</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut now, my dear Cyrus, all this industrial and commercial movement to\
  \ which you predict a continual advance, does it not run the danger of being sooner\
  \ or later completely stopped?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CStopped! And by what?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBy the want of coal, which may justly be called the most precious of minerals.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, the most precious indeed,\u201D replied the engineer; \u201Cand it\
  \ would seem that nature wished to prove that it was so by making the diamond, which\
  \ is simply pure carbon crystallized.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou don\u2019t mean to say, captain,\u201D interrupted Pencroft, \u201C\
  that we burn diamonds in our stoves in the shape of coal?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, my friend,\u201D replied Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHowever,\u201D resumed Gideon Spilett, \u201Cyou do not deny that some\
  \ day the coal will be entirely consumed?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh! the veins of coal are still considerable, and the hundred thousand\
  \ miners who annually extract from them a hundred millions of hundredweights have\
  \ not nearly exhausted them.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWith the increasing consumption of coal,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett,\
  \ \u201Cit can be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two\
  \ hundred thousand, and that the rate of extraction will be doubled.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDoubtless; but after the European mines, which will be soon worked more\
  \ thoroughly with new machines, the American and Australian mines will for a long\
  \ time yet provide for the consumption in trade.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFor how long a time?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFor at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is reassuring for us, but a bad look\u2011out for our great\u2011\
  grandchildren!\u201D observed Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey will discover something else,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is to be hoped so,\u201D answered Spilett, \u201Cfor without coal there\
  \ would be no machinery, and without machinery there would be no railways, no steamers,\
  \ no manufactories, nothing of that which is indispensable to modern civilization!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut what will they find?\u201D asked Pencroft. \u201CCan you guess, captain?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNearly, my friend.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd what will they burn instead of coal?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWater,\u201D replied Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWater!\u201D cried Pencroft, \u201Cwater as fuel for steamers and engines!\
  \ water to heat water!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, but water decomposed into its primitive elements,\u201D replied Cyrus\
  \ Harding, \u201Cand decomposed doubtless, by electricity, which will then have\
  \ become a powerful and manageable force, for all great discoveries, by some inexplicable\
  \ laws, appear to agree and become complete at the same time. Yes, my friends, I\
  \ believe that water will one day be employed as fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen\
  \ which constitute it, used singly or together, will furnish an inexhaustible source\
  \ of heat and light, of an intensity of which coal is not capable. Some day the\
  \ coalrooms of steamers and the tenders of locomotives will, instead of coal, be\
  \ stored with these two condensed gases, which will burn in the furnaces with enormous\
  \ calorific power. There is, therefore, nothing to fear. As long as the earth is\
  \ inhabited it will supply the wants of its inhabitants, and there will be no want\
  \ of either light or heat as long as the productions of the vegetable, mineral or\
  \ animal kingdoms do not fail us. I believe, then, that when the deposits of coal\
  \ are exhausted we shall heat and warm ourselves with water. Water will be the coal\
  \ of the future.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI should like to see that,\u201D observed the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou were born too soon, Pencroft,\u201D returned Neb, who only took part\
  \ in the discussion by these words.</p>"
- "<p>However, it was not Neb\u2019s speech which interrupted the conversation, but\
  \ Top\u2019s barking, which broke out again with that strange intonation which had\
  \ before perplexed the engineer. At the same time Top began to run round the mouth\
  \ of the well, which opened at the extremity of the interior passage.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat can Top be barking in that way for?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd Jup be growling like that?\u201D added Herbert.</p>"
- <p>In fact the orang, joining the dog, gave unequivocal signs of agitation, and,
  singular to say, the two animals appeared more uneasy than angry.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is evident,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cthat this well is in direct\
  \ communication with the sea, and that some marine animal comes from time to time\
  \ to breathe at the bottom.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat\u2019s evident,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cand there can be\
  \ no other explanation to give. Quiet there, Top!\u201D added Pencroft, turning\
  \ to the dog, \u201Cand you, Jup, be off to your room!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The ape and the dog were silent. Jup went off to bed, but Top remained in the
  room, and continued to utter low growls at intervals during the rest of the evening.
  There was no further talk on the subject, but the incident, however, clouded the
  brow of the engineer.</p>
- "<p>During the remainder of the month of July there was alternate rain and frost.\
  \ The temperature was not so low as during the preceding winter, and its maximum\
  \ did not exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit. But although this winter was less cold,\
  \ it was more troubled by storms and squalls; the sea besides often endangered the\
  \ safety of the Chimneys. At times it almost seemed as if an under\u2011current\
  \ raised these monstrous billows which thundered against the wall of Granite House.</p>"
- <p>When the settlers, leaning from their windows, gazed on the huge watery masses
  breaking beneath their eyes, they could not but admire the magnificent spectacle
  of the ocean in its impotent fury. The waves rebounded in dazzling foam, the beach
  entirely disapppearing under the raging flood, and the cliff appearing to emerge
  from the sea itself, the spray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet.</p>
- "<p>During these storms it was difficult and even dangerous to venture out, owing\
  \ to the frequently falling trees; however, the colonists never allowed a week to\
  \ pass without having paid a visit to the corral. Happily, this enclosure, sheltered\
  \ by the southeastern spur of Mount Franklin, did not greatly suffer from the violence\
  \ of the hurricanes, which spared its trees, sheds, and palisades; but the poultry\u2011\
  yard on Prospect Heights, being directly exposed to the gusts of wind from the east,\
  \ suffered considerable damage. The pigeon\u2011house was twice unroofed and the\
  \ paling blown down. All this required to be remade more solidly than before, for,\
  \ as may be clearly seen, Lincoln Island was situated in one of the most dangerous\
  \ parts of the Pacific. It really appeared as if it formed the central point of\
  \ vast cyclones, which beat it perpetually as the whip does the top, only here it\
  \ was the top which was motionless and the whip which moved. During the first week\
  \ of the month of August the weather became more moderate, and the atmosphere recovered\
  \ the calm which it appeared to have lost forever. With the calm the cold again\
  \ became intense, and the thermometer fell to eight degrees Fahrenheit, below zero.</p>"
- <p>On the 3rd of August an excursion which had been talked of for several days was
  made into the southeastern part of the island, towards Tadorn Marsh. The hunters
  were tempted by the aquatic game which took up their winter quarters there. Wild
  duck, snipe, teal and grebe abounded there, and it was agreed that a day should
  be devoted to an expedition against these birds.</p>
- <p>Not only Gideon Spilett and Herbert, but Pencroft and Neb also took part in this
  excursion. Cyrus Harding alone, alleging some work as an excuse, did not join them,
  but remained at Granite House.</p>
- <p>The hunters proceeded in the direction of Port Balloon, in order to reach the
  marsh, after having promised to be back by the evening. Top and Jup accompanied
  them. As soon as they had passed over the Mercy Bridge, the engineer raised it and
  returned, intending to put into execution a project for the performance of which
  he wished to be alone.</p>
- <p>Now this project was to minutely explore the interior well, the mouth of which
  was on a level with the passage of Granite House, and which communicated with the
  sea, since it formerly supplied a way to the waters of the lake.</p>
- <p>Why did Top so often run round this opening? Why did he utter such strange barks
  when a sort of uneasiness seemed to draw him towards this well? Why did Jup join
  Top in a sort of common anxiety? Had this well branches besides the communication
  with the sea? Did it spread towards other parts of the island? This is what Cyrus
  Harding wished to know. He had resolved, therefore, to attempt the exploration of
  the well during the absence of his companions, and an opportunity for doing so had
  now presented itself.</p>
- <p>It was easy to descend to the bottom of the well by employing the rope ladder
  which had not been used since the establishment of the lift. The engineer drew the
  ladder to the hole, the diameter of which measured nearly six feet, and allowed
  it to unroll itself after having securely fastened its upper extremity. Then, having
  lighted a lantern, taken a revolver, and placed a cutlass in his belt, he began
  the descent.</p>
- <p>The sides were everywhere entire; but points of rock jutted out here and there,
  and by means of these points it would have been quite possible for an active creature
  to climb to the mouth of the well.</p>
- <p>The engineer remarked this; but although he carefully examined these points by
  the light of his lantern, he could find no impression, no fracture which could give
  any reason to suppose that they had either recently or at any former time been used
  as a staircase. Cyrus Harding descended deeper, throwing the light of his lantern
  on all sides.</p>
- <p>He saw nothing suspicious.</p>
- <p>When the engineer had reached the last rounds he came upon the water, which was
  then perfectly calm. Neither at its level nor in any other part of the well, did
  any passage open, which could lead to the interior of the cliff. The wall which
  Harding struck with the hilt of his cutlass sounded solid. It was compact granite,
  through which no living being could force a way. To arrive at the bottom of the
  well and then climb up to its mouth it was necessary to pass through the channel
  under the rocky subsoil of the beach, which placed it in communication with the
  sea, and this was only possible for marine animals. As to the question of knowing
  where this channel ended, at what point of the shore, and at what depth beneath
  the water, it could not be answered.</p>
- "<p>Then Cyrus Harding, having ended his survey, re\u2011ascended, drew up the ladder,\
  \ covered the mouth of the well, and returned thoughtfully to the diningroom, saying\
  \ to himself,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI have seen nothing, and yet there is something there!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 12</p>
- <p>In the evening the hunters returned, having enjoyed good sport, and being literally
  loaded with game; indeed, they had as much as four men could possibly carry. Top
  wore a necklace of teal and Jup wreaths of snipe round his body.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHere, master,\u201D cried Neb; \u201Chere\u2019s something to employ our\
  \ time! Preserved and made into pies we shall have a welcome store! But I must have\
  \ some one to help me. I count on you, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Neb,\u201D replied the sailor; \u201CI have the rigging of the vessel\
  \ to finish and to look after, and you will have to do without me.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd you, Mr. Herbert?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI must go to the corral to\u2011morrow, Neb,\u201D replied the lad.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt will be you then, Mr. Spilett, who will help me?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo oblige you, Neb, I will,\u201D replied the reporter; \u201Cbut I warn\
  \ you that if you disclose your recipes to me, I shall publish them.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhenever you like, Mr. Spilett,\u201D replied Neb; \u201Cwhenever you\
  \ like.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>And so the next day Gideon Spilett became Neb\u2019s assistant and was installed\
  \ in his culinary laboratory. The engineer had previously made known to him the\
  \ result of the exploration which he had made the day before, and on this point\
  \ the reporter shared Harding\u2019s opinion, that although he had found nothing,\
  \ a secret still remained to be discovered!</p>"
- "<p>The frost continued for another week, and the settlers did not leave Granite\
  \ House unless to look after the poultry\u2011yard. The dwelling was filled with\
  \ appetizing odors, which were emitted from the learned manipulation of Neb and\
  \ the reporter. But all the results of the chase were not made into preserved provisions;\
  \ and as the game kept perfectly in the intense cold, wild duck and other fowl were\
  \ eaten fresh, and declared superior to all other aquatic birds in the known world.</p>"
- "<p>During this week, Pencroft, aided by Herbert, who handled the sailmaker\u2019\
  s needle with much skill, worked with such energy that the sails of the vessel were\
  \ finished. There was no want of cordage. Thanks to the rigging which had been discovered\
  \ with the case of the balloon, the ropes and cables from the net were all of good\
  \ quality, and the sailor turned them all to account. To the sails were attached\
  \ strong bolt ropes, and there still remained enough from which to make the halyards,\
  \ shrouds, and sheets, etc. The blocks were manufactured by Cyrus Harding under\
  \ Pencroft\u2019s directions by means of the turning lathe. It therefore happened\
  \ that the rigging was entirely prepared before the vessel was finished. Pencroft\
  \ also manufactured a flag, that flag so dear to every true American, containing\
  \ the stars and stripes of their glorious Union. The colors for it were supplied\
  \ from certain plants used in dyeing, and which were very abundant in the island;\
  \ only to the thirty\u2011seven stars, representing the thirty\u2011seven States\
  \ of the Union, which shine on the American flag, the sailor added a thirty\u2011\
  eighth, the star of \u201Cthe State of Lincoln,\u201D for he considered his island\
  \ as already united to the great republic. \u201CAnd,\u201D said he, \u201Cit is\
  \ so already in heart, if not in deed!\u201D</p>"
- <p>In the meantime, the flag was hoisted at the central window of Granite House,
  and the settlers saluted it with three cheers.</p>
- <p>The cold season was now almost at an end, and it appeared as if this second winter
  was to pass without any unusual occurrence, when on the night of the 11th of August,
  the plateau of Prospect Heights was menaced with complete destruction.</p>
- "<p>After a busy day the colonists were sleeping soundly, when towards four o\u2019\
  clock in the morning they were suddenly awakened by Top\u2019s barking.</p>"
- <p>The dog was not this time barking near the mouth of the well, but at the threshold
  of the door, at which he was scratching as if he wished to burst it open. Jup was
  also uttering piercing cries.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHello, Top!\u201D cried Neb, who was the first awake. But the dog continued\
  \ to bark more furiously than ever.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter now?\u201D asked Harding.</p>"
- <p>And all dressing in haste rushed to the windows, which they opened.</p>
- <p>Beneath their eyes was spread a sheet of snow which looked gray in the dim light.
  The settlers could see nothing, but they heard a singular yelping noise away in
  the darkness. It was evident that the beach had been invaded by a number of animals
  which could not be seen.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat are they?\u201D cried Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWolves, jaguars, or apes?\u201D replied Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey have nearly reached the plateau,\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd our poultry\u2011yard,\u201D exclaimed Herbert, \u201Cand our garden!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhere can they have crossed?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey must have crossed the bridge on the shore,\u201D replied the engineer,\
  \ \u201Cwhich one of us must have forgotten to close.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTrue,\u201D said Spilett, \u201CI remember having left it open.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CA fine job you have made of it, Mr. Spilett,\u201D cried the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is done cannot be undone,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding. \u201CWe must\
  \ consult what it will now be best to do.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Such were the questions and answers which were rapidly exchanged between Harding
  and his companions. It was certain that the bridge had been crossed, that the shore
  had been invaded by animals, and that whatever they might be they could by ascending
  the left bank of the Mercy reach Prospect Heights. They must therefore be advanced
  against quickly and fought with if necessary.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut what are these beasts?\u201D was asked a second time, as the yelpings\
  \ were again heard more loudly than before. These yelps made Herbert start, and\
  \ he remembered having heard them before during his first visit to the sources of\
  \ the Red Creek.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey are colpeo foxes!\u201D he exclaimed.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CForward!\u201D shouted the sailor.</p>"
- <p>And all arming themselves with hatchets, carbines, and revolvers, threw themselves
  into the lift and soon set foot on the shore.</p>
- <p>Colpeos are dangerous animals when in great numbers and irritated by hunger,
  nevertheless the colonists did not hesitate to throw themselves into the midst of
  the troop, and their first shots vividly lighting up the darkness made their assailants
  draw back.</p>
- "<p>The chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the plateau, for\
  \ the garden and the poultry\u2011yard would then have been at their mercy, and\
  \ immense, perhaps irreparable mischief, would inevitably be the result, especially\
  \ with regard to the corn\u2011field. But as the invasion of the plateau could only\
  \ be made by the left bank of the Mercy, it was sufficient to oppose the colpeos\
  \ on the narrow bank between the river and the cliff of granite.</p>"
- "<p>This was plain to all, and, by Cyrus Harding\u2019s orders, they reached the\
  \ spot indicated by him, while the colpeos rushed fiercely through the gloom. Harding,\
  \ Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft and Neb posted themselves in impregnable line.\
  \ Top, his formidable jaws open, preceded the colonists, and he was followed by\
  \ Jup, armed with a knotty cudgel, which he brandished like a club.</p>"
- <p>The night was extremely dark, it was only by the flashes from the revolvers as
  each person fired that they could see their assailants, who were at least a hundred
  in number, and whose eyes were glowing like hot coals.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThey must not pass!\u201D shouted Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey shall not pass!\u201D returned the engineer.</p>"
- <p>But if they did not pass it was not for want of having attempted it. Those in
  the rear pushed on the foremost assailants, and it was an incessant struggle with
  revolvers and hatchets. Several colpeos already lay dead on the ground, but their
  number did not appear to diminish, and it might have been supposed that reinforcements
  were continually arriving over the bridge.</p>
- <p>The colonists were soon obliged to fight at close quarters, not without receiving
  some wounds, though happily very slight ones. Herbert had, with a shot from his
  revolver, rescued Neb, on whose back a colpeo had sprung like a tiger cat. Top fought
  with actual fury, flying at the throats of the foxes and strangling them instantaneously.
  Jup wielded his weapon valiantly, and it was in vain that they endeavored to keep
  him in the rear. Endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to pierce the obscurity,
  he was always in the thick of the fight uttering from time to time?a sharp hissing
  sound, which was with him the sign of great rejoicing.</p>
- <p>At one moment he advanced so far, that by the light from a revolver he was seen
  surrounded by five or six large colpeos, with whom he was coping with great coolness.</p>
- <p>However, the struggle was ended at last, and victory was on the side of the settlers,
  but not until they had fought for two long hours! The first signs of the approach
  of day doubtless determined the retreat of their assailants, who scampered away
  towards the North, passing over the bridge, which Neb ran immediately to raise.
  When day had sufficiently lighted up the field of battle, the settlers counted as
  many as fifty dead bodies scattered about on the shore.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAnd Jup!\u201D cried Pencroft; \u201Cwhere is Jup?\u201D Jup had disappeared.\
  \ His friend Neb called him, and for the first time Jup did not reply to his friend\u2019\
  s call.</p>"
- <p>Everyone set out in search of Jup, trembling lest he should be found among the
  slain; they cleared the place of the bodies which stained the snow with their blood.
  Jup was found in the midst of a heap of colpeos whose broken jaws and crushed bodies
  showed that they had to do with the terrible club of the intrepid animal.</p>
- <p>Poor Jup still held in his hand the stump of his broken cudgel, but deprived
  of his weapon he had been overpowered by numbers, and his chest was covered with
  severe wounds.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHe is living,\u201D cried Neb, who was bending over him.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd we will save him,\u201D replied the sailor. \u201CWe will nurse him\
  \ as if he was one of ourselves.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>It appeared as if Jup understood, for he leaned his head on Pencroft\u2019s\
  \ shoulder as if to thank him. The sailor was wounded himself, but his wound was\
  \ insignificant, as were those of his companions; for thanks to their firearms they\
  \ had been almost always able to keep their assailants at a distance. It was therefore\
  \ only the orang whose condition was serious.</p>"
- "<p>Jup, carried by Neb and Pencroft, was placed in the lift, and only a slight\
  \ moan now and then escaped his lips. He was gently drawn up to Granite House. There\
  \ he was laid on a mattress taken from one of the beds, and his wounds were bathed\
  \ with the greatest care. It did not appear that any vital part had been reached,\
  \ but Jup was very weak from loss of blood, and a high fever soon set in after his\
  \ wounds had been dressed. He was laid down, strict diet was imposed, \u201Cjust\
  \ like a real person,\u201D as Neb said, and they made him swallow several cups\
  \ of a cooling drink, for which the ingredients were supplied from the vegetable\
  \ medicine chest of Granite House. Jup was at first restless, but his breathing\
  \ gradually became more regular, and he was left sleeping quietly. From time to\
  \ time Top, walking on tip\u2011toe, as one might say, came to visit his friend,\
  \ and seemed to approve of all the care that had been taken of him. One of Jup\u2019\
  s hands hung over the side of his bed, and Top licked it with a sympathizing air.</p>"
- <p>They employed the day in interring the dead, who were dragged to the forest of
  the Far West, and there buried deep.</p>
- <p>This attack, which might have had such serious consequences, was a lesson to
  the settlers, who from this time never went to bed until one of their number had
  made sure that all the bridges were raised, and that no invasion was possible.</p>
- <p>However, Jup, after having given them serious anxiety for several days, began
  to recover. His constitution brought him through, the fever gradually subsided,
  and Gideon Spilett, who was a bit of a doctor, pronounced him quite out of danger.
  On the 16th of August, Jup began to eat. Neb made him nice little sweet dishes,
  which the invalid devoured with great relish, for if he had a pet failing it was
  that of being somewhat of a gourmand, and Neb had never done anything to cure him
  of this fault.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat would you have?\u201D said he to Gideon Spilett, who sometimes expostulated\
  \ with him for spoiling the ape. \u201CPoor Jup has no other pleasure than that\
  \ of the palate, and I am only too glad to be able to reward his services in this\
  \ way!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Ten days after taking to his bed, on the 21st of August, Master Jup arose. His\
  \ wounds were healed, and it was evident that he would not be long in regaining\
  \ his usual strength and agility. Like all convalescents, he was tremendously hungry,\
  \ and the reporter allowed him to eat as much as he liked, for he trusted to that\
  \ instinct, which is too often wanting in reasoning beings, to keep the orang from\
  \ any excess. Neb was delighted to see his pupil\u2019s appetite returning.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CEat away, my Jup,\u201D said he, \u201Cand don\u2019t spare anything;\
  \ you have shed your blood for us, and it is the least I can do to make you strong\
  \ again!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>On the 25th of August Neb\u2019s voice was heard calling to his companions.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain, Mr. Spilett, Mr. Herbert, Pencroft, come! come!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The colonists, who were together in the dining\u2011room, rose at Neb\u2019\
  s call, who was then in Jup\u2019s room.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLook,\u201D replied Neb, with a shout of laughter. And what did they see?\
  \ Master Jup smoking calmly and seriously, sitting crosslegged like a Turk at the\
  \ entrance to Granite House!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy pipe,\u201D cried Pencroft. \u201CHe has taken my pipe! Hello, my honest\
  \ Jup, I make you a present of it! Smoke away, old boy, smoke away!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And Jup gravely puffed out clouds of smoke which seemed to give him great satisfaction.
  Harding did not appear to be much astonished at this incident, and he cited several
  examples of tame apes, to whom the use of tobacco had become quite familiar.</p>
- "<p>But from this day Master Jup had a pipe of his own, the sailor\u2019s ex\u2011\
  pipe, which was hung in his room near his store of tobacco. He filled it himself,\
  \ lighted it with a glowing coal, and appeared to be the happiest of quadrumana.\
  \ It may readily be understood that this similarity of tastes of Jup and Pencroft\
  \ served to tighten the bonds of friendship which already existed between the honest\
  \ ape and the worthy sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps he is really a man,\u201D said Pencroft sometimes to Neb. \u201C\
  Should you be surprised to hear him beginning to speak to us some day?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy word, no,\u201D replied Neb. \u201CWhat astonishes me is that he hasn\u2019\
  t spoken to us before, for now he wants nothing but speech!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt would amuse me all the same,\u201D resumed the sailor, \u201Cif some\
  \ fine day he said to me, ?Suppose we change pipes, Pencroft.\u201C</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Neb, \u201Cwhat a pity he was born dumb!\u201D</p>"
- <p>With the month of September the winter ended, and the works were again eagerly
  commenced. The building of the vessel advanced rapidly, she was already completely
  decked over, and all the inside parts of the hull were firmly united with ribs bent
  by means of steam, which answered all the purposes of a mold.</p>
- <p>As there was no want of wood, Pencroft proposed to the engineer to give a double
  lining to the hull, to insure the strength of the vessel.</p>
- "<p>Harding, not knowing what the future might have in store for them, approved\
  \ the sailor\u2019s idea of making the craft as strong as possible. The interior\
  \ and deck of the vessel was entirely finished towards the 15th of September. For\
  \ calking the seams they made oakum of dry seaweed, which was hammered in between\
  \ the planks; then these seams were covered with boiling tar, which was obtained\
  \ in great abundance from the pines in the forest.</p>"
- <p>The management of the vessel was very simple. She had from the first been ballasted
  with heavy blocks of granite walled up, in a bed of lime, twelve thousand pounds
  of which they stowed away.</p>
- <p>A deck was placed over this ballast, and the interior was divided into two cabins;
  two benches extended along them and served also as lockers. The foot of the mast
  supported the partition which separated the two cabins, which were reached by two
  hatchways let into the deck.</p>
- <p>Pencroft had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast. He chose a straight
  young fir, with no knots, and which he had only to square at the step, and round
  off at the top. The ironwork of the mast, the rudder and the hull had been roughly
  but strongly forged at the Chimneys. Lastly, yards, masts, boom, spars, oars, etc.,
  were all furnished by the first week in October, and it was agreed that a trial
  trip should be taken round the island, so as to ascertain how the vessel would behave
  at sea, and how far they might depend upon her.</p>
- <p>During all this time the necessary works had not been neglected. The corral was
  enlarged, for the flock of musmons and goats had been increased by a number of young
  ones, who had to be housed and fed. The colonists had paid visits also to the oyster
  bed, the warren, the coal and iron mines, and to the till then unexplored districts
  of the Far West forest, which abounded in game. Certain indigenous plants were discovered,
  and those fit for immediate use contributed to vary the vegetable stores of Granite
  House.</p>
- <p>They were a species of ficoide, some similar to those of the Cape, with eatable
  fleshy leaves, others bearing seeds containing a sort of flour.</p>
- "<p>On the 10th of October the vessel was launched. Pencroft was radiant with joy,\
  \ the operation was perfectly successful; the boat completely rigged, having been\
  \ pushed on rollers to the water\u2019s edge, was floated by the rising tide, amid\
  \ the cheers of the colonists, particularly of Pencroft, who showed no modesty on\
  \ this occasion. Besides his importance was to last beyond the finishing of the\
  \ vessel, since, after having built her, he was to command her. The grade of captain\
  \ was bestowed upon him with the approbation of all. To satisfy Captain Pencroft,\
  \ it was now necessary to give a name to the vessel, and, after many propositions\
  \ had been discussed, the votes were all in favor of the \u201CBonadventure.\u201D\
  \ As soon as the \u201CBonadventure\u201D had been lifted by the rising tide, it\
  \ was seen that she lay evenly in the water, and would be easily navigated. However,\
  \ the trial trip was to be made that very day, by an excursion off the coast. The\
  \ weather was fine, the breeze fresh, and the sea smooth, especially towards the\
  \ south coast, for the wind was blowing from the northwest.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAll hands on board,\u201D shouted Pencroft; but breakfast was first necessary,\
  \ and it was thought best to take provisions on board, in the event of their excursion\
  \ being prolonged until the evening.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding was equally anxious to try the vessel, the model of which had\
  \ originated with him, although on the sailor\u2019s advice he had altered some\
  \ parts of it, but he did not share Pencroft\u2019s confidence in her, and as the\
  \ latter had not again spoken of the voyage to Tabor Island, Harding hoped he had\
  \ given it up. He would have indeed great reluctance in letting two or three of\
  \ his companions venture so far in so small a boat, which was not of more than fifteen\
  \ tons\u2019 burden.</p>"
- "<p>At half\u2011past ten everybody was on board, even Top and Jup, and Herbert\
  \ weighed the anchor, which was fast in the sand near the mouth of the Mercy. The\
  \ sail was hoisted, the Lincolnian flag floated from the masthead, and the \u201C\
  Bonadventure,\u201D steered by Pencroft, stood out to sea.</p>"
- "<p>The wind blowing out of Union Bay she ran before it, and thus showed her owners,\
  \ much to their satisfaction, that she possessed a remarkably fast pair of heels,\
  \ according to Pencroft\u2019s mode of speaking. After having doubled Flotsam Point\
  \ and Claw Cape, the captain kept her close hauled, so as to sail along the southern\
  \ coast of the island, when it was found she sailed admirably within five points\
  \ of the wind. All hands were enchanted, they had a good vessel, which, in case\
  \ of need, would be of great service to them, and with fine weather and a fresh\
  \ breeze the voyage promised to be charming.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft now stood off the shore, three or four miles across from Port Balloon.
  The island then appeared in all its extent and under a new aspect, with the varied
  panorama of its shore from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the forests in which dark firs
  contrasted with the young foliage of other trees and overlooked the whole, and Mount
  Franklin whose lofty head was still whitened with snow.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHow beautiful it is!\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, our island is beautiful and good,\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201C\
  I love it as I loved my poor mother. It received us poor and destitute, and now\
  \ what is wanting to us five fellows who fell on it from the sky?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNothing,\u201D replied Neb; \u201Cnothing, captain.\u201D</p>"
- <p>And the two brave men gave three tremendous cheers in honor of their island!</p>
- <p>During all this time Gideon Spilett, leaning against the mast, sketched the panorama
  which was developed before his eyes.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding gazed on it in silence.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, Captain Harding,\u201D asked Pencroft, \u201Cwhat do you think of\
  \ our vessel?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CShe appears to behave well,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGood! And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some extent?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat voyage, Pencroft?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COne to Tabor Island, for instance.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy friend,\u201D replied Harding, \u201CI think that in any pressing emergency\
  \ we need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the ?Bonadventure\u2019 even for a\
  \ longer voyage; but you know I should see you set off to Tabor Island with great\
  \ uneasiness, since nothing obliges you to go there.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COne likes to know one\u2019s neighbors,\u201D returned the sailor, who\
  \ was obstinate in his idea. \u201CTabor Island is our neighbor, and the only one!\
  \ Politeness requires us to go at least to pay a visit.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBy Jove,\u201D said Spilett, \u201Cour friend Pencroft has become very\
  \ particular about the proprieties all at once!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am not particular about anything at all,\u201D retorted the sailor,\
  \ who was rather vexed by the engineer\u2019s opposition, but who did not wish to\
  \ cause him anxiety.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CConsider, Pencroft,\u201D resumed Harding, \u201Cyou cannot go alone to\
  \ Tabor Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COne companion will be enough for me.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CEven so,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cyou will risk depriving the\
  \ colony of Lincoln Island of two settlers out of five.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COut of six,\u201D answered Pencroft; \u201Cyou forget Jup.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COut of seven,\u201D added Neb; \u201CTop is quite worth another.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere is no risk at all in it, captain,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is possible, Pencroft; but I repeat it is to expose ourselves uselessly.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The obstinate sailor did not reply, and let the conversation drop, quite determined
  to resume it again. But he did not suspect that an incident would come to his aid
  and change into an act of humanity that which was at first only a doubtful whim.</p>
- "<p>After standing off the shore the \u201CBonadventure\u201D again approached it\
  \ in the direction of Port Balloon. It was important to ascertain the channels between\
  \ the sandbanks and reefs, that buoys might be laid down since this little creek\
  \ was to be the harbor.</p>"
- "<p>They were not more than half a mile from the coast, and it was necessary to\
  \ tack to beat against the wind. The \u201CBonadventure\u201D was then going at\
  \ a very moderate rate, as the breeze, partly intercepted by the high land, scarcely\
  \ swelled her sails, and the sea, smooth as glass, was only rippled now and then\
  \ by passing gusts.</p>"
- <p>Herbert had stationed himself in the bows that he might indicate the course to
  be followed among the channels, when all at once he shouted,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CLuff, Pencroft, luff!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter,\u201D replied the sailor; \u201Ca rock?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo?wait,\u201D said Herbert; \u201CI don\u2019t quite see. Luff again?right?now.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>So saying, Herbert, leaning over the side, plunged his arm into the water, and
  pulled it out, exclaiming,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CA bottle!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>He held in his hand a corked bottle which he had just seized a few cables\u2019\
  \ length from the shore.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding took the bottle. Without uttering a single word he drew the cork,
  and took from it a damp paper, on which were written these words:?</p>
- "<p>\u201CCastaway.... Tabor island: 153deg W. long., 37deg 11\u2019 S. lat.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Chapter 13</p>
- "<p>\u201CA castaway!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft; \u201Cleft on this Tabor Island\
  \ not two hundred miles from us! Ah, Captain Harding, you won\u2019t now oppose\
  \ my going.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Pencroft,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding; \u201Cand you shall set out\
  \ as soon as possible.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo\u2011morrow?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo\u2011morrow!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The engineer still held in his hand the paper which he had taken from the bottle.
  He contemplated it for some instants, then resumed,</p>
- "<p>\u201CFrom this document, my friends, from the way in which it is worded, we\
  \ may conclude this: first, that the castaway on Tabor Island is a man possessing\
  \ a considerable knowledge of navigation, since he gives the latitude and longitude\
  \ of the island exactly as we ourselves found it, and to a second of approximation;\
  \ secondly, that he is either English or American, as the document is written in\
  \ the English language.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is perfectly logical,\u201D answered Spilett; \u201Cand the presence\
  \ of this castaway explains the arrival of the case on the shores of our island.\
  \ There must have been a wreck, since there is a castaway. As to the latter, whoever\
  \ he may be, it is lucky for him that Pencroft thought of building this boat and\
  \ of trying her this very day, for a day later and this bottle might have been broken\
  \ on the rocks.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIndeed,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cit is a fortunate chance that the ?Bonadventure\u2019\
  \ passed exactly where the bottle was still floating!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDoes not this appear strange to you?\u201D asked Harding of Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt appears fortunate, that\u2019s all,\u201D answered the sailor. \u201C\
  Do you see anything extraordinary in it, captain? The bottle must go somewhere,\
  \ and why not here as well as anywhere else?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps you are right, Pencroft,\u201D replied the engineer; \u201Cand\
  \ yet?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D observed Herbert, \u201Cthere\u2019s nothing to prove that\
  \ this bottle has been floating long in the sea.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNothing,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, \u201Cand the document appears\
  \ even to have been recently written. What do you think about it, Cyrus?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>During this conversation Pencroft had not remained inactive. He had put the\
  \ vessel about, and the \u201CBonadventure,\u201D all sails set, was running rapidly\
  \ towards Claw Cape.</p>"
- <p>Every one was thinking of the castaway on Tabor Island. Should they be in time
  to save him? This was a great event in the life of the colonists! They themselves
  were but castaways, but it was to be feared that another might not have been so
  fortunate, and their duty was to go to his succor.</p>
- "<p>Claw Cape was doubled, and about four o\u2019clock the \u201CBonadventure\u201D\
  \ dropped her anchor at the mouth of the Mercy.</p>"
- "<p>That same evening the arrangements for the new expedition were made. It appeared\
  \ best that Pencroft and Herbert, who knew how to work the vessel, should undertake\
  \ the voyage alone. By setting out the next day, the 10th of October, they would\
  \ arrive on the 13th, for with the present wind it would not take more than forty\u2011\
  eight hours to make this passage of a hundred and fifty miles. One day in the island,\
  \ three or four to return, they might hope therefore that on the 17th they would\
  \ again reach Lincoln Island. The weather was fine, the barometer was rising, the\
  \ wind appeared settled, everything then was in favor of these brave men whom an\
  \ act of humanity was taking far from their island.</p>"
- <p>Thus it had been agreed that Cyrus Harding, Neb, and Gideon Spilett should remain
  at Granite House, but an objection was raised, and Spilett, who had not forgotten
  his business as reporter to the New York Herald, having declared that he would go
  by swimming rather than lose such an opportunity, he was admitted to take a part
  in the voyage.</p>
- "<p>The evening was occupied in transporting on board the \u201CBonadventure,\u201D\
  \ articles of bedding, utensils, arms, ammunition, a compass, provisions for a week;\
  \ this being rapidly done, the colonists ascended to Granite House.</p>"
- "<p>The next day, at five o\u2019clock in the morning, the farewells were said,\
  \ not without some emotion on both sides, and Pencroft setting sail made towards\
  \ Claw Cape, which had to be doubled in order to proceed to the southwest.</p>"
- "<p>The \u201CBonadventure\u201D was already a quarter of a mile from the coast\
  \ when the passengers perceived on the heights of Granite House two men waving their\
  \ farewells; they were Cyrus Harding and Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COur friends,\u201D exclaimed Spilett, \u201Cthis is our first separation\
  \ in fifteen months.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Pencroft, the reporter and Herbert waved in return, and Granite House soon disappeared
  behind the high rocks of the Cape.</p>
- "<p>During the first part of the day the \u201CBonadventure\u201D was still in sight\
  \ of the southern coast of Lincoln Island, which soon appeared just like a green\
  \ basket, with Mount Franklin rising from the center. The heights, diminished by\
  \ distance, did not present an appearance likely to tempt vessels to touch there.\
  \ Reptile End was passed in about an hour, though at a distance of about ten miles.</p>"
- <p>At this distance it was no longer possible to distinguish anything of the Western
  Coast, which stretched away to the ridges of Mount Franklin, and three hours after
  the last of Lincoln Island sank below the horizon.</p>
- "<p>The \u201CBonadventure\u201D behaved capitally. Bounding over the waves she\
  \ proceeded rapidly on her course. Pencroft had hoisted the foresail, and steering\
  \ by the compass followed a rectilinear direction. From time to time Herbert relieved\
  \ him at the helm, and the lad\u2019s hand was so firm that the sailor had not a\
  \ point to find fault with.</p>"
- <p>Gideon Spilett chatted sometimes with one, sometimes with the other, if wanted
  he lent a hand with the ropes, and Captain Pencroft was perfectly satisfied with
  his crew.</p>
- <p>In the evening the crescent moon, which would not be in its first quarter until
  the 16th, appeared in the twilight and soon set again. The night was dark but starry,
  and the next day again promised to be fine.</p>
- <p>Pencroft prudently lowered the foresail, not wishing to be caught by a sudden
  gust while carrying too much canvas; it was perhaps an unnecessary precaution on
  such a calm night, but Pencroft was a prudent sailor and cannot be blamed for it.</p>
- "<p>The reporter slept part of the night. Pencroft and Herbert took turns for a\
  \ spell of two hours each at the helm. The sailor trusted Herbert as he would himself,\
  \ and his confidence was justified by the coolness and judgment of the lad. Pencroft\
  \ gave him his directions as a commander to his steersman, and Herbert never allowed\
  \ the \u201CBonadventure\u201D to swerve even a point. The night passed quickly,\
  \ as did the day of the 12th of October. A south\u2011easterly direction was strictly\
  \ maintained. Unless the \u201CBonadventure\u201D fell in with some unknown current\
  \ she would come exactly within sight of Tabor Island.</p>"
- <p>As to the sea over which the vessel was then sailing, it was absolutely deserted.
  Now and then a great albatross or frigate bird passed within gunshot, and Gideon
  Spilett wondered if it was to one of them that he had confided his last letter addressed
  to the New York Herald. These birds were the only beings that appeared to frequent
  this part of the ocean between Tabor and Lincoln Islands.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAnd yet,\u201D observed Herbert, \u201Cthis is the time that whalers usually\
  \ proceed towards the southern part of the Pacific. Indeed I do not think there\
  \ could be a more deserted sea than this.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is not quite so deserted as all that,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe are on it. Do you take our vessel for a wreck and us for porpoises?\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>And Pencroft laughed at his joke.</p>
- "<p>By the evening, according to calculation, it was thought that the \u201CBonadventure\u201D\
  \ had accomplished a distance of a hundred and twenty miles since her departure\
  \ from Lincoln Island, that is to say in thirty\u2011six hours, which would give\
  \ her a speed of between three and four knots. The breeze was very slight and might\
  \ soon drop altogether. However, it was hoped that the next morning by break of\
  \ day, if the calculation had been correct and the course true, they would sight\
  \ Tabor Island.</p>"
- <p>Neither Gideon Spilett, Herbert, nor Pencroft slept that night. In the expectation
  of the next day they could not but feel some emotion. There was so much uncertainty
  in their enterprise! Were they near Tabor Island? Was the island still inhabited
  by the castaway to whose succor they had come? Who was this man? Would not his presence
  disturb the little colony till then so united? Besides, would he be content to exchange
  his prison for another? All these questions, which would no doubt be answered the
  next day, kept them in suspense, and at the dawn of day they all fixed their gaze
  on the western horizon.</p>
- "<p>\u201CLand!\u201D shouted Pencroft at about six o\u2019clock in the morning.</p>"
- "<p>And it was impossible that Pencroft should be mistaken, it was evident that\
  \ land was there. Imagine the joy of the little crew of the \u201CBonadventure.\u201D\
  \ In a few hours they would land on the beach of the island!</p>"
- <p>The low coast of Tabor Island, scarcely emerging from the sea, was not more than
  fifteen miles distant.</p>
- "<p>The head of the \u201CBonadventure,\u201D which was a little to the south of\
  \ the island, was set directly towards it, and as the sun mounted in the east, its\
  \ rays fell upon one or two headlands.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis is a much less important isle than Lincoln Island,\u201D observed\
  \ Herbert, \u201Cand is probably due like ours to some submarine convulsion.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>At eleven o\u2019clock the \u201CBonadventure\u201D was not more than two miles\
  \ off, and Pencroft, while looking for a suitable place at which to land, proceeded\
  \ very cautiously through the unknown waters. The whole of the island could now\
  \ be surveyed, and on it could be seen groups of gum and other large trees, of the\
  \ same species as those growing on Lincoln Island. But the astonishing thing was\
  \ that no smoke arose to show that the island was inhabited, no signal whatever\
  \ appeared on the shore!</p>"
- <p>And yet the document was clear enough; there was a castaway, and this castaway
  should have been on the watch.</p>
- "<p>In the meanwhile the \u201CBonadventure\u201D entered the winding channels among\
  \ the reefs, and Pencroft observed every turn with extreme care. He had put Herbert\
  \ at the helm, posting himself in the bows, inspecting the water, while he held\
  \ the halliard in his hand, ready to lower the sail at a moment\u2019s notice. Gideon\
  \ Spilett with his glass eagerly scanned the shore, though without perceiving anything.</p>"
- "<p>However, at about twelve o\u2019clock the keel of the \u201CBonadventure\u201D\
  \ grated on the bottom. The anchor was let go, the sails furled, and the crew of\
  \ the little vessel landed.</p>"
- <p>And there was no reason to doubt that this was Tabor Island, since according
  to the most recent charts there was no island in this part of the Pacific between
  New Zealand and the American Coast.</p>
- <p>The vessel was securely moored, so that there should be no danger of her being
  carried away by the receding tide; then Pencroft and his companions, well armed,
  ascended the shore, so as to gain an elevation of about two hundred and fifty or
  three hundred feet which rose at a distance of half a mile.</p>
- "<p>\u201CFrom the summit of that hill,\u201D said Spilett, \u201Cwe can no doubt\
  \ obtain a complete view of the island, which will greatly facilitate our search.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CSo as to do here,\u201D replied Herbert, \u201Cthat which Captain Harding\
  \ did the very first thing on Lincoln Island, by climbing Mount Franklin.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CExactly so,\u201D answered the reporter, \u201Cand it is the best plan.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>While thus talking the explorers had advanced along a clearing which terminated\
  \ at the foot of the hill. Flocks of rock\u2011pigeons and sea\u2011swallows, similar\
  \ to those of Lincoln Island, fluttered around them. Under the woods which skirted\
  \ the glade on the left they could hear the bushes rustling and see the grass waving,\
  \ which indicated the presence of timid animals, but still nothing to show that\
  \ the island was inhabited.</p>"
- <p>Arrived at the foot of the hill, Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert climbed it in
  a few minutes, and gazed anxiously round the horizon.</p>
- <p>They were on an islet, which did not measure more than six miles in circumference,
  its shape not much bordered by capes or promontories, bays or creeks, being a lengthened
  oval. All around, the lonely sea extended to the limits of the horizon. No land
  nor even a sail was in sight.</p>
- <p>This woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of Lincoln Island, arid and
  wild in one part, but fertile and rich in the other. On the contrary this was a
  uniform mass of verdure, out of which rose two or three hills of no great height.
  Obliquely to the oval of the island ran a stream through a wide meadow falling into
  the sea on the west by a narrow mouth.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe domain is limited,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D rejoined Pencroft: \u201CIt would have been too small for us.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd moreover,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cit appears to be uninhabited.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIndeed,\u201D answered Herbert, \u201Cnothing here betrays the presence\
  \ of man.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us go down,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cand search.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The sailor and his two companions returned to the shore, to the place where\
  \ they had left the \u201CBonadventure.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>They had decided to make the tour of the island on foot, before exploring the\
  \ interior; so that not a spot should escape their investigations. The beach was\
  \ easy to follow, and only in some places was their way barred by large rocks, which,\
  \ however, they easily passed round. The explorers proceeded towards the south,\
  \ disturbing numerous flocks of sea\u2011birds and herds of seals, which threw themselves\
  \ into the sea as soon as they saw the strangers at a distance.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThose beasts yonder,\u201D observed the reporter, \u201Cdo not see men\
  \ for the first time. They fear them, therefore they must know them.\u201D</p>"
- <p>An hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point of the islet,
  terminated by a sharp cape, and proceeded towards the north along the western coast,
  equally formed by sand and rocks, the background bordered with thick woods.</p>
- "<p>There was not a trace of a habitation in any part, not the print of a human\
  \ foot on the shore of the island, which after four hours\u2019 walking had been\
  \ gone completely round.</p>"
- <p>It was to say the least very extraordinary, and they were compelled to believe
  that Tabor Island was not or was no longer inhabited. Perhaps, after all the document
  was already several months or several years old, and it was possible in this case,
  either that the castaway had been enabled to return to his country, or that he had
  died of misery.</p>
- "<p>Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert, forming more or less probable conjectures, dined\
  \ rapidly on board the \u201CBonadventure\u201D so as to be able to continue their\
  \ excursion until nightfall. This was done at five o\u2019clock in the evening,\
  \ at which hour they entered the wood.</p>"
- <p>Numerous animals fled at their approach, being principally, one might say, only
  goats and pigs, which were obviously European species.</p>
- <p>Doubtless some whaler had landed them on the island, where they had rapidly increased.
  Herbert resolved to catch one or two living, and take them back to Lincoln Island.</p>
- <p>It was no longer doubtful that men at some period or other had visited this islet,
  and this became still more evident when paths appeared trodden through the forest,
  felled trees, and everywhere traces of the hand of man; but the trees were becoming
  rotten, and had been felled many years ago; the marks of the axe were velveted with
  moss, and the grass grew long and thick on the paths, so that it was difficult to
  find them.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D observed Gideon Spilett, \u201Cthis not only proves that men\
  \ have landed on the island, but also that they lived on it for some time. Now,\
  \ who were these men? How many of them remain?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe document,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Conly spoke of one castaway.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, if he is still on the island,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cit is\
  \ impossible but that we shall find him.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The exploration was continued. The sailor and his companions naturally followed
  the route which cut diagonally across the island, and they were thus obliged to
  follow the stream which flowed towards the sea.</p>
- <p>If the animals of European origin, if works due to a human hand, showed incontestably
  that men had already visited the island, several specimens of the vegetable kingdom
  did not prove it less. In some places, in the midst of clearings, it was evident
  that the soil had been planted with culinary plants, at probably the same distant
  period.</p>
- "<p>What, then, was Herbert\u2019s joy, when he recognized potatoes, chicory, sorrel,\
  \ carrots, cabbages, and turnips, of which it was sufficient to collect the seed\
  \ to enrich the soil of Lincoln Island.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCapital, jolly!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft. \u201CThat will suit Neb as\
  \ well as us. Even if we do not find the castaway, at least our voyage will not\
  \ have been useless, and God will have rewarded us.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDoubtless,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, \u201Cbut to see the state in\
  \ which we find these plantations, it is to be feared that the island has not been\
  \ inhabited for some time.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIndeed,\u201D answered Herbert, \u201Can inhabitant, whoever he was, could\
  \ not have neglected such an important culture!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cthe castaway has gone.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe must suppose so.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt must then be admitted that the document has already a distant date?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CEvidently.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd that the bottle only arrived at Lincoln Island after having floated\
  \ in the sea a long time.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy not?\u201D returned Pencroft. \u201CBut night is coming on,\u201D\
  \ added he, \u201Cand I think that it will be best to give up the search for the\
  \ present.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us go on board, and to\u2011morrow we will begin again,\u201D said\
  \ the reporter.</p>"
- <p>This was the wisest course, and it was about to be followed when Herbert, pointing
  to a confused mass among the trees, exclaimed,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CA hut!\u201D</p>"
- <p>All three immediately ran towards the dwelling. In the twilight it was just possible
  to see that it was built of planks and covered with a thick tarpaulin.</p>
- "<p>The half\u2011closed door was pushed open by Pencroft, who entered with a rapid\
  \ step.</p>"
- <p>The hut was empty!</p>
- <p>Chapter 14</p>
- <p>Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett remained silent in the midst of the darkness.</p>
- <p>Pencroft shouted loudly.</p>
- <p>No reply was made.</p>
- <p>The sailor then struck a light and set fire to a twig. This lighted for a minute
  a small room, which appeared perfectly empty. At the back was a rude fireplace,
  with a few cold cinders, supporting an armful of dry wood. Pencroft threw the blazing
  twig on it, the wood crackled and gave forth a bright light.</p>
- "<p>The sailor and his two companions then perceived a disordered bed, of which\
  \ the damp and yellow coverlets proved that it had not been used for a long time.\
  \ In the corner of the fireplace were two kettles, covered with rust, and an overthrown\
  \ pot. A cupboard, with a few moldy sailor\u2019s clothes; on the table a tin plate\
  \ and a Bible, eaten away by damp; in a corner a few tools, a spade, pickaxe, two\
  \ fowling\u2011pieces, one of which was broken; on a plank, forming a shelf, stood\
  \ a barrel of powder, still untouched, a barrel of shot, and several boxes of caps,\
  \ all thickly covered with dust, accumulated, perhaps, by many long years.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere is no one here,\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo one,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is a long time since this room has been inhabited,\u201D observed Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, a very long time!\u201D answered the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMr. Spilett,\u201D then said Pencroft, \u201Cinstead of returning on board,\
  \ I think that it would be well to pass the night in this hut.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are right, Pencroft,\u201D answered Gideon Spilett, \u201Cand if its\
  \ owner returns, well! perhaps he will not be sorry to find the place taken possession\
  \ of.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe will not return,\u201D said the sailor, shaking his head.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou think that he has quitted the island?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf he had quitted the island he would have taken away his weapons and\
  \ his tools,\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201CYou know the value which castaways set\
  \ on such articles as these the last remains of a wreck. No! no!\u201D repeated\
  \ the sailor, in a tone of conviction; \u201Cno, he has not left the island! If\
  \ he had escaped in a boat made by himself, he would still less have left these\
  \ indispensable and necessary articles. No! he is on the island!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLiving?\u201D asked Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLiving or dead. But if he is dead, I suppose he has not buried himself,\
  \ and so we shall at least find his remains!\u201D</p>"
- <p>It was then agreed that the night should be passed in the deserted dwelling,
  and a store of wood found in a corner was sufficient to warm it. The door closed,
  Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett remained there, seated on a bench, talking little
  but wondering much. They were in a frame of mind to imagine anything or expect anything.
  They listened eagerly for sounds outside. The door might have opened suddenly, and
  a man presented himself to them without their being in the least surprised, notwithstanding
  all that the hut revealed of abandonment, and they had their hands ready to press
  the hands of this man, this castaway, this unknown friend, for whom friends were
  waiting.</p>
- <p>But no voice was heard, the door did not open. The hours thus passed away.</p>
- <p>How long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions! Herbert alone slept
  for two hours, for at his age sleep is a necessity. They were all three anxious
  to continue their exploration of the day before, and to search the most secret recesses
  of the islet! The inferences deduced by Pencroft were perfectly reasonable, and
  it was nearly certain that, as the hut was deserted, and the tools, utensils, and
  weapons were still there, the owner had succumbed. It was agreed, therefore, that
  they should search for his remains, and give them at least Christian burial.</p>
- "<p>Day dawned; Pencroft and his companions immediately proceeded to survey the\
  \ dwelling. It had certainly been built in a favorable situation, at the back of\
  \ a little hill, sheltered by five or six magnificent gum\u2011trees. Before its\
  \ front and through the trees the axe had prepared a wide clearing, which allowed\
  \ the view to extend to the sea. Beyond a lawn, surrounded by a wooden fence falling\
  \ to pieces, was the shore, on the left of which was the mouth of the stream.</p>"
- <p>The hut had been built of planks, and it was easy to see that these planks had
  been obtained from the hull or deck of a ship. It was probable that a disabled vessel
  had been cast on the coast of the island, that one at least of the crew had been
  saved, and that by means of the wreck this man, having tools at his disposal, had
  built the dwelling.</p>
- <p>And this became still more evident when Gideon Spilett, after having walked around
  the hut, saw on a plank, probably one of those which had formed the armor of the
  wrecked vessel, these letters already half effaced:</p>
- <p>              BR?TAN?A</p>
- "<p>\u201CBritannia,\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, whom the reporter had called; \u201C\
  it is a common name for ships, and I could not say if she was English or American!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt matters very little, Pencroft!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery little indeed,\u201D answered the sailor, \u201Cand we will save\
  \ the survivor of her crew if he is still living, to whatever country he may belong.\
  \ But before beginning our search again let us go on board the ?Bonadventure\u2019\
  .\u201D</p>"
- <p>A sort of uneasiness had seized Pencroft upon the subject of his vessel. Should
  the island be inhabited after all, and should some one have taken possession of
  her? But he shrugged his shoulders at such an unreasonable supposition. At any rate
  the sailor was not sorry to go to breakfast on board. The road already trodden was
  not long, scarcely a mile. They set out on their walk, gazing into the wood and
  thickets through which goats and pigs fled in hundreds.</p>
- "<p>Twenty minutes after leaving the hut Pencroft and his companions reached the\
  \ western coast of the island, and saw the \u201CBonadventure\u201D held fast by\
  \ her anchor, which was buried deep in the sand.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft could not restrain a sigh of satisfaction. After all this vessel was
  his child, and it is the right of fathers to be often uneasy when there is no occasion
  for it.</p>
- <p>They returned on board, breakfasted, so that it should not be necessary to dine
  until very late; then the repast being ended, the exploration was continued and
  conducted with the most minute care. Indeed, it was very probable that the only
  inhabitant of the island had perished. It was therefore more for the traces of a
  dead than of a living man that Pencroft and his companions searched. But their searches
  were vain, and during the half of that day they sought to no purpose among the thickets
  of trees which covered the islet. There was then scarcely any doubt that, if the
  castaway was dead, no trace of his body now remained, but that some wild beast had
  probably devoured it to the last bone.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe will set off to\u2011morrow at daybreak,\u201D said Pencroft to his\
  \ two companions, as about two o\u2019clock they were resting for a few minutes\
  \ under the shade of a clump of firs.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI should think that we might without scruple take the utensils which belonged\
  \ to the castaway,\u201D added Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI think so, too,\u201D returned Gideon Spilett, \u201Cand these arms and\
  \ tools will make up the stores of Granite House. The supply of powder and shot\
  \ is also most important.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cbut we must not forget to capture a\
  \ couple or two of those pigs, of which Lincoln Island is destitute.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNor to gather those seeds,\u201D added Herbert, \u201Cwhich will give\
  \ us all the vegetables of the Old and the New Worlds.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen perhaps it would be best,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cto remain\
  \ a day longer on Tabor Island, so as to collect all that may be useful to us.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Mr. Spilett,\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201CI will ask you to set\
  \ off to\u2011morrow at daybreak. The wind seems to me to be likely to shift to\
  \ the west, and after having had a fair wind for coming we shall have a fair wind\
  \ for going back.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen do not let us lose time,\u201D said Herbert, rising.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe won\u2019t waste time,\u201D returned Pencroft. \u201CYou, Herbert,\
  \ go and gather the seeds, which you know better than we do. While you do that,\
  \ Mr. Spilett and I will go and have a pig hunt, and even without Top I hope we\
  \ shall manage to catch a few!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Herbert accordingly took the path which led towards the cultivated part of the
  islet, while the sailor and the reporter entered the forest.</p>
- <p>Many specimens of the porcine race fled before them, and these animals, which
  were singularly active, did not appear to be in a humor to allow themselves to be
  approached.</p>
- "<p>However, after an hour\u2019s chase, the hunters had just managed to get hold\
  \ of a couple lying in a thicket, when cries were heard resounding from the north\
  \ part of the island, With the cries were mingled terrible yells, in which there\
  \ was nothing human.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft and Gideon Spilett were at once on their feet, and the pigs by this
  movement began to run away, at the moment when the sailor was getting ready the
  rope to bind them.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThat\u2019s Herbert\u2019s voice,\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CRun!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>And the sailor and Spilett immediately ran at full speed towards the spot from
  whence the cries proceeded.</p>
- <p>They did well to hasten, for at a turn of the path near a clearing they saw the
  lad thrown on the ground and in the grasp of a savage being, apparently a gigantic
  ape, who was about to do him some great harm.</p>
- "<p>To rush on this monster, throw him on the ground in his turn, snatch Herbert\
  \ from him, then bind him securely, was the work of a minute for Pencroft and Gideon\
  \ Spilett. The sailor was of Herculean strength, the reporter also very powerful,\
  \ and in spite of the monster\u2019s resistance he was firmly tied so that he could\
  \ not even move.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are not hurt, Herbert?\u201D asked Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, no!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh, if this ape had wounded him!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut he is not an ape,\u201D answered Herbert.</p>"
- <p>At these words Pencroft and Gideon Spilett looked at the singular being who lay
  on the ground. Indeed it was not an ape; it was a human being, a man. But what a
  man! A savage in all the horrible acceptation of the word, and so much the more
  frightful that he seemed fallen to the lowest degree of brutishness!</p>
- <p>Shaggy hair, untrimmed beard descending to the chest, the body almost naked except
  a rag round the waist, wild eyes, enormous hands with immensely long nails, skin
  the color of mahogany, feet as hard as if made of horn, such was the miserable creature
  who yet had a claim to be called a man. But it might justly be asked if there were
  yet a soul in this body, or if the brute instinct alone survived in it!</p>
- "<p>\u201CAre you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?\u201D\
  \ said Pencroft to the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAlas! there is no doubt about it,\u201D replied Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen this must be the castaway?\u201D asked Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, \u201Cbut the unfortunate man has no\
  \ longer anything human about him!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The reporter spoke the truth. It was evident that if the castaway had ever been
  a civilized being, solitude had made him a savage, or worse, perhaps a regular man
  of the woods. Hoarse sounds issued from his throat between his teeth, which were
  sharp as the teeth of a wild beast made to tear raw flesh.</p>
- <p>Memory must have deserted him long before, and for a long time also he had forgotten
  how to use his gun and tools, and he no longer knew how to make a fire! It could
  be seen that he was active and powerful, but the physical qualities had been developed
  in him to the injury of the moral qualities. Gideon Spilett spoke to him. He did
  not appear to understand or even to hear. And yet on looking into his eyes, the
  reporter thought he could see that all reason was not extinguished in him. However,
  the prisoner did not struggle, nor even attempt to break his bonds. Was he overwhelmed
  by the presence of men whose fellow he had once been? Had he found in some corner
  of his brain a fleeting remembrance which recalled him to humanity? If free, would
  he attempt to fly, or would he remain? They could not tell, but they did not make
  the experiment; and after gazing attentively at the miserable creature,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhoever he may be,\u201D remarked Gideon Spilett, \u201Cwhoever he may\
  \ have been, and whatever he may become, it is our duty to take him with us to Lincoln\
  \ Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, yes!\u201D replied Herbert, \u201Cand perhaps with care we may arouse\
  \ in him some gleam of intelligence.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe soul does not die,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cand it would be\
  \ a great satisfaction to rescue one of God\u2019s creatures from brutishness.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Pencroft shook his head doubtfully.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe must try at any rate,\u201D returned the reporter; \u201Chumanity commands\
  \ us.\u201D</p>"
- <p>It was indeed their duty as Christians and civilized beings. All three felt this,
  and they well knew that Cyrus Harding would approve of their acting thus.</p>
- "<p>\u201CShall we leave him bound?\u201D asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps he would walk if his feet were unfastened,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us try,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>The cords which shackled the prisoner\u2019s feet were cut off, but his arms\
  \ remained securely fastened. He got up by himself and did not manifest any desire\
  \ to run away. His hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the three men, who walked\
  \ near him, but nothing denoted that he recollected being their fellow, or at least\
  \ having been so. A continual hissing sound issued from his lips, his aspect was\
  \ wild, but he did not attempt to resist.</p>"
- "<p>By the reporter\u2019s advice the unfortunate man was taken to the hut. Perhaps\
  \ the sight of the things that belonged to him would make some impression on him!\
  \ Perhaps a spark would be sufficient to revive his obscured intellect, to rekindle\
  \ his dulled soul. The dwelling was not far off. In a few minutes they arrived there,\
  \ but the prisoner remembered nothing, and it appeared that he had lost consciousness\
  \ of everything.</p>"
- <p>What could they think of the degree of brutishness into which this miserable
  being had fallen, unless that his imprisonment on the islet dated from a very distant
  period and after having arrived there a rational being solitude had reduced him
  to this condition.</p>
- "<p>The reporter then thought that perhaps the sight of fire would have some effect\
  \ on him, and in a moment one of those beautiful flames, that attract even animals,\
  \ blazed up on the hearth. The sight of the flame seemed at first to fix the attention\
  \ of the unhappy object, but soon he turned away and the look of intelligence faded.\
  \ Evidently there was nothing to be done, for the time at least, but to take him\
  \ on board the \u201CBonadventure.\u201D This was done, and he remained there in\
  \ Pencroft\u2019s charge.</p>"
- <p>Herbert and Spilett returned to finish their work; and some hours after they
  came back to the shore, carrying the utensils and guns, a store of vegetables, of
  seeds, some game, and two couple of pigs.</p>
- "<p>All was embarked, and the \u201CBonadventure\u201D was ready to weigh anchor\
  \ and sail with the morning tide.</p>"
- "<p>The prisoner had been placed in the fore\u2011cabin, where he remained quiet,\
  \ silent, apparently deaf and dumb.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft offered him something to eat, but he pushed away the cooked meat that
  was presented to him and which doubtless did not suit him. But on the sailor showing
  him one of the ducks which Herbert had killed, he pounced on it like a wild beast,
  and devoured it greedily.</p>
- "<p>\u201CYou think that he will recover his senses?\u201D asked Pencroft. \u201C\
  It is not impossible that our care will have an effect upon him, for it is solitude\
  \ that has made him what he is, and from this time forward he will be no longer\
  \ alone.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long time,\u201D\
  \ said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps,\u201D answered Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAbout what age is he?\u201D asked the lad.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is difficult to say,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Cfor it is impossible\
  \ to see his features under the thick beard which covers his face, but he is no\
  \ longer young, and I suppose he might be about fifty.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHave you noticed, Mr. Spilett, how deeply sunk his eyes are?\u201D asked\
  \ Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Herbert, but I must add that they are more human than one could expect\
  \ from his appearance.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHowever, we shall see,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cand I am anxious\
  \ to know what opinion Captain Harding will have of our savage. We went to look\
  \ for a human creature, and we are bringing back a monster! After all, we did what\
  \ we could.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The night passed, and whether the prisoner slept or not could not be known, but
  at any rate, although he had been unbound, he did not move. He was like a wild animal,
  which appears stunned at first by its capture, and becomes wild again afterwards.</p>
- "<p>At daybreak the next morning, the 15th of October, the change of weather predicted\
  \ by Pencroft occurred. The wind having shifted to the northwest favored the return\
  \ of the \u201CBonadventure,\u201D but at the same time it freshened, which might\
  \ render navigation more difficult.</p>"
- "<p>At five o\u2019clock in the morning the anchor was weighed. Pencroft took a\
  \ reef in the mainsail, and steered towards the north\u2011east, so as to sail straight\
  \ for Lincoln Island.</p>"
- "<p>The first day of the voyage was not marked by any incident. The prisoner remained\
  \ quiet in the fore\u2011cabin, and as he had been a sailor it appeared that the\
  \ motion of the vessel might produce on him a salutary reaction. Did some recollection\
  \ of his former calling return to him? However that might be, he remained tranquil,\
  \ astonished rather than depressed.</p>"
- "<p>The next day the wind increased, blowing more from the north, consequently in\
  \ a less favorable direction for the \u201CBonadventure.\u201D Pencroft was soon\
  \ obliged to sail close\u2011hauled, and without saying anything about it he began\
  \ to be uneasy at the state of the sea, which frequently broke over the bows. Certainly,\
  \ if the wind did not moderate, it would take a longer time to reach Lincoln Island\
  \ than it had taken to make Tabor Island.</p>"
- "<p>Indeed, on the morning of the 17th, the \u201CBonadventure\u201D had been forty\u2011\
  eight hours at sea, and nothing showed that she was near the island. It was impossible,\
  \ besides, to estimate the distance traversed, or to trust to the reckoning for\
  \ the direction, as the speed had been very irregular.</p>"
- "<p>Twenty\u2011four hours after there was yet no land in sight. The wind was right\
  \ ahead and the sea very heavy. The sails were close\u2011reefed, and they tacked\
  \ frequently. On the 18th, a wave swept completely over the \u201CBonadventure\u201D\
  ; and if the crew had not taken the precaution of lashing themselves to the deck,\
  \ they would have been carried away.</p>"
- "<p>On this occasion Pencroft and his companions, who were occupied with loosing\
  \ themselves, received unexpected aid from the prisoner, who emerged from the hatchway\
  \ as if his sailor\u2019s instinct had suddenly returned, broke a piece out of the\
  \ bulwarks with a spar so as to let the water which filled the deck escape. Then\
  \ the vessel being clear, he descended to his cabin without having uttered a word.\
  \ Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, greatly astonished, let him proceed.</p>"
- <p>Their situation was truly serious, and the sailor had reason to fear that he
  was lost on the wide sea without any possibility of recovering his course.</p>
- "<p>The night was dark and cold. However, about eleven o\u2019clock, the wind fell,\
  \ the sea went down, and the speed of the vessel, as she labored less, greatly increased.</p>"
- "<p>Neither Pencroft, Spilett, nor Herbert thought of taking an hour\u2019s sleep.\
  \ They kept a sharp look\u2011out, for either Lincoln Island could not be far distant\
  \ and would be sighted at daybreak, or the \u201CBonadventure,\u201D carried away\
  \ by currents, had drifted so much that it would be impossible to rectify her course.\
  \ Pencroft, uneasy to the last degree, yet did not despair, for he had a gallant\
  \ heart, and grasping the tiller he anxiously endeavored to pierce the darkness\
  \ which surrounded them.</p>"
- "<p>About two o\u2019clock in the morning he started forward,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA light! a light!\u201D he shouted.</p>"
- <p>Indeed, a bright light appeared twenty miles to the northeast. Lincoln Island
  was there, and this fire, evidently lighted by Cyrus Harding, showed them the course
  to be followed. Pencroft, who was bearing too much to the north, altered his course
  and steered towards the fire, which burned brightly above the horizon like a star
  of the first magnitude.</p>
- <p>Chapter 15</p>
- "<p>The next day, the 20th of October, at seven o\u2019clock in the morning, after\
  \ a voyage of four days, the \u201CBonadventure\u201D gently glided up to the beach\
  \ at the mouth of the Mercy.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding and Neb, who had become very uneasy at the bad weather and the
  prolonged absence of their companions, had climbed at daybreak to the plateau of
  Prospect Heights, and they had at last caught sight of the vessel which had been
  so long in returning.</p>
- "<p>\u201CGod be praised! there they are!\u201D exclaimed Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>As to Neb in his joy, he began to dance, to twirl round, clapping his hands\
  \ and shouting, \u201COh! my master!\u201D A more touching pantomime than the finest\
  \ discourse.</p>"
- "<p>The engineer\u2019s first idea, on counting the people on the deck of the \u201C\
  Bonadventure,\u201D was that Pencroft had not found the castaway of Tabor Island,\
  \ or at any rate that the unfortunate man had refused to leave his island and change\
  \ one prison for another.</p>"
- "<p>Indeed Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert were alone on the deck of the \u201C\
  Bonadventure.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The moment the vessel touched, the engineer and Neb were waiting on the beach,\
  \ and before the passengers had time to leap on to the sand, Harding said: \u201C\
  We have been very uneasy at your delay, my friends! Did you meet with any accident?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett; \u201Con the contrary, everything went\
  \ wonderfully well. We will tell you all about it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHowever,\u201D returned the engineer, \u201Cyour search has been unsuccessful,\
  \ since you are only three, just as you went!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CExcuse me, captain,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cwe are four.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou have found the castaway?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd you have brought him?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLiving?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhere is he? Who is he?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe is,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Cor rather he was a man! There,\
  \ Cyrus, that is all we can tell you!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The engineer was then informed of all that had passed during the voyage, and
  under what conditions the search had been conducted; how the only dwelling in the
  island had long been abandoned; how at last a castaway had been captured, who appeared
  no longer to belong to the human species.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAnd that\u2019s just the point,\u201D added Pencroft, \u201CI don\u2019\
  t know if we have done right to bring him here.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCertainly you have, Pencroft,\u201D replied the engineer quickly.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut the wretched creature has no sense!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is possible at present,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cbut only\
  \ a few months ago the wretched creature was a man like you and me. And who knows\
  \ what will become of the survivor of us after a long solitude on this island? It\
  \ is a great misfortune to be alone, my friends; and it must be believed that solitude\
  \ can quickly destroy reason, since you have found this poor creature in such a\
  \ state!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, captain,\u201D asked Herbert, \u201Cwhat leads you to think that\
  \ the brutishness of the unfortunate man began only a few months back?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBecause the document we found had been recently written,\u201D answered\
  \ the engineer, \u201Cand the castaway alone can have written it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAlways supposing,\u201D observed Gideon Spilett, \u201Cthat it had not\
  \ been written by a companion of this man, since dead.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is impossible, my dear Spilett.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy so?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBecause the document would then have spoken of two castaways,\u201D replied\
  \ Harding, \u201Cand it mentioned only one.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Herbert then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage, and dwelt on\
  \ the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the prisoner\u2019s mind, when\
  \ for an instant in the height of the storm he had become a sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, Herbert,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cyou are right to attach\
  \ great importance to this fact. The unfortunate man cannot be incurable, and despair\
  \ has made him what he is; but here he will find his fellow\u2011men, and since\
  \ there is still a soul in him, this soul we shall save!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The castaway of Tabor Island, to the great pity of the engineer and the great\
  \ astonishment of Neb, was then brought from the cabin which he occupied in the\
  \ fore part of the \u201CBonadventure\u201D; when once on land he manifested a wish\
  \ to run away.</p>"
- <p>But Cyrus Harding approaching, placed his hand on his shoulder with a gesture
  full of authority, and looked at him with infinite tenderness. Immediately the unhappy
  man, submitting to a superior will, gradually became calm, his eyes fell, his head
  bent, and he made no more resistance.</p>
- "<p>\u201CPoor fellow!\u201D murmured the engineer.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding had attentively observed him. To judge by his appearance this miserable
  being had no longer anything human about him, and yet Harding, as had the reporter
  already, observed in his look an indefinable trace of intelligence.</p>
- <p>It was decided that the castaway, or rather the stranger as he was thenceforth
  termed by his companions, should live in one of the rooms of Granite House, from
  which, however, he could not escape. He was led there without difficulty, and with
  careful attention, it might, perhaps, be hoped that some day he would be a companion
  to the settlers in Lincoln Island.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding, during breakfast, which Neb had hastened to prepare, as the reporter,\
  \ Herbert, and Pencroft were dying of hunger, heard in detail all the incidents\
  \ which had marked the voyage of exploration to the islet. He agreed with his friends\
  \ on this point, that the stranger must be either English or American, the name\
  \ Britannia leading them to suppose this, and, besides, through the bushy beard,\
  \ and under the shaggy, matted hair, the engineer thought he could recognize the\
  \ characteristic features of the Anglo\u2011Saxon.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, by the bye,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, addressing Herbert, \u201C\
  you never told us how you met this savage, and we know nothing, except that you\
  \ would have been strangled, if we had not happened to come up in time to help you!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CUpon my word,\u201D answered Herbert, \u201Cit is rather difficult to\
  \ say how it happened. I was, I think, occupied in collecting my plants, when I\
  \ heard a noise like an avalanche falling from a very tall tree. I scarcely had\
  \ time to look round. This unfortunate man, who was without doubt concealed in a\
  \ tree, rushed upon me in less time than I take to tell you about it, and unless\
  \ Mr. Spilett and Pencroft?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy boy!\u201D said Cyrus Harding, \u201Cyou ran a great danger, but, perhaps,\
  \ without that, the poor creature would have still hidden himself from your search,\
  \ and we should not have had a new companion.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou hope, then, Cyrus, to succeed in reforming the man?\u201D asked the\
  \ reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>Breakfast over, Harding and his companions left Granite House and returned to\
  \ the beach. They there occupied themselves in unloading the \u201CBonadventure,\u201D\
  \ and the engineer, having examined the arms and tools, saw nothing which could\
  \ help them to establish the identity of the stranger.</p>"
- <p>The capture of pigs, made on the islet, was looked upon as being very profitable
  to Lincoln Island, and the animals were led to the sty, where they soon became at
  home.</p>
- "<p>The two barrels, containing the powder and shot, as well as the box of caps,\
  \ were very welcome. It was agreed to establish a small powder\u2011magazine, either\
  \ outside Granite House or in the Upper Cavern, where there would be no fear of\
  \ explosion. However, the use of pyroxyle was to be continued, for this substance\
  \ giving excellent results, there was no reason for substituting ordinary powder.</p>"
- <p>When the unloading of the vessel was finished,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CCaptain,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201CI think it would be prudent to put\
  \ our ?Bonadventure\u2019 in a safe place.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIs she not safe at the mouth of the Mercy?\u201D asked Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, captain,\u201D replied the sailor. \u201CHalf of the time she is stranded\
  \ on the sand, and that works her. She is a famous craft, you see, and she behaved\
  \ admirably during the squall which struck us on our return.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCould she not float in the river?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo doubt, captain, she could; but there is no shelter there, and in the\
  \ east winds, I think that the ?Bonadventure\u2019 would suffer much from the surf.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, where would you put her, Pencroft?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn Port Balloon,\u201D replied the sailor. \u201CThat little creek, shut\
  \ in by rocks, seems to me to be just the harbor we want.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIs it not rather far?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPooh! it is not more than three miles from Granite House, and we have\
  \ a fine straight road to take us there!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDo it then, Pencroft, and take your ?Bonadventure\u2019 there,\u201D replied\
  \ the engineer, \u201Cand yet I would rather have her under our more immediate protection.\
  \ When we have time, we must make a little harbor for her.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFamous!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft. \u201CA harbor with a lighthouse, a\
  \ pier, and dock! Ah! really with you, captain, everything becomes easy.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, my brave Pencroft,\u201D answered the engineer, \u201Cbut on condition,\
  \ however, that you help me, for you do as much as three men in all our work.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>Herbert and the sailor then re\u2011embarked on board the \u201CBonadventure,\u201D\
  \ the anchor was weighed, the sail hoisted, and the wind drove her rapidly towards\
  \ Claw Cape. Two hours after, she was reposing on the tranquil waters of Port Balloon.</p>"
- <p>During the first days passed by the stranger in Granite House, had he already
  given them reason to think that his savage nature was becoming tamed? Did a brighter
  light burn in the depths of that obscured mind? In short, was the soul returning
  to the body?</p>
- <p>Yes, to a certainty, and to such a degree, that Cyrus Harding and the reporter
  wondered if the reason of the unfortunate man had ever been totally extinguished.
  At first, accustomed to the open air, to the unrestrained liberty which he had enjoyed
  on Tabor Island, the stranger manifested a sullen fury, and it was feared that he
  might throw himself onto the beach, out of one of the windows of Granite House.
  But gradually he became calmer, and more freedom was allowed to his movements.</p>
- "<p>They had reason to hope, and to hope much. Already, forgetting his carnivorous\
  \ instincts, the stranger accepted a less bestial nourishment than that on which\
  \ he fed on the islet, and cooked meat did not produce in him the same sentiment\
  \ of repulsion which he had showed on board the \u201CBonadventure.\u201D Cyrus\
  \ Harding had profited by a moment when he was sleeping, to cut his hair and matted\
  \ beard, which formed a sort of mane and gave him such a savage aspect. He had also\
  \ been clothed more suitably, after having got rid of the rag which covered him.\
  \ The result was that, thanks to these attentions, the stranger resumed a more human\
  \ appearance, and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder. Certainly, when\
  \ formerly lighted up by intelligence, this man\u2019s face must have had a sort\
  \ of beauty.</p>"
- "<p>Every day, Harding imposed on himself the task of passing some hours in his\
  \ company. He came and worked near him, and occupied himself in different things,\
  \ so as to fix his attention. A spark, indeed, would be sufficient to reillumine\
  \ that soul, a recollection crossing that brain to recall reason. That had been\
  \ seen, during the storm, on board the \u201CBonadventure!\u201D The engineer did\
  \ not neglect either to speak aloud, so as to penetrate at the same time by the\
  \ organs of hearing and sight the depths of that torpid intelligence. Sometimes\
  \ one of his companions, sometimes another, sometimes all joined him. They spoke\
  \ most often of things belonging to the navy, which must interest a sailor.</p>"
- <p>At times, the stranger gave some slight attention to what was said, and the settlers
  were soon convinced that he partly understood them. Sometimes the expression of
  his countenance was deeply sorrowful, a proof that he suffered mentally, for his
  face could not be mistaken; but he did not speak, although at different times, however,
  they almost thought that words were about to issue from his lips. At all events,
  the poor creature was quite quiet and sad!</p>
- <p>But was not his calm only apparent? Was not his sadness only the result of his
  seclusion? Nothing could yet be ascertained. Seeing only certain objects and in
  a limited space, always in contact with the colonists, to whom he would soon become
  accustomed, having no desires to satisfy, better fed, better clothed, it was natural
  that his physical nature should gradually improve; but was he penetrated with the
  sense of a new life? or rather, to employ a word which would be exactly applicable
  to him, was he not becoming tamed, like an animal in company with his master? This
  was an important question, which Cyrus Harding was anxious to answer, and yet he
  did not wish to treat his invalid roughly! Would he ever be a convalescent?</p>
- <p>How the engineer observed him every moment! How he was on the watch for his soul,
  if one may use the expression! How he was ready to grasp it! The settlers followed
  with real sympathy all the phases of the cure undertaken by Harding. They aided
  him also in this work of humanity, and all, except perhaps the incredulous Pencroft,
  soon shared both his hope and his faith.</p>
- <p>The calm of the stranger was deep, as has been said, and he even showed a sort
  of attachment for the engineer, whose influence he evidently felt. Cyrus Harding
  resolved then to try him, by transporting him to another scene, from that ocean
  which formerly his eyes had been accustomed to contemplate, to the border of the
  forest, which might perhaps recall those where so many years of his life had been
  passed!</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Ccan we hope that he will not escape,\
  \ if once set at liberty?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe experiment must be tried,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell!\u201D said Pencroft. \u201CWhen that fellow is outside, and feels\
  \ the fresh air, he will be off as fast as his legs can carry him!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI do not think so,\u201D returned Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us try,\u201D said Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe will try,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- <p>This was on the 30th of October, and consequently the castaway of Tabor Island
  had been a prisoner in Granite House for nine days. It was warm, and a bright sun
  darted its rays on the island. Cyrus Harding and Pencroft went to the room occupied
  by the stranger, who was found lying near the window and gazing at the sky.</p>
- "<p>\u201CCome, my friend,\u201D said the engineer to him.</p>"
- <p>The stranger rose immediately. His eyes were fixed on Cyrus Harding, and he followed
  him, while the sailor marched behind them, little confident as to the result of
  the experiment.</p>
- <p>Arrived at the door, Harding and Pencroft made him take his place in the lift,
  while Neb, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett waited for them before Granite House. The
  lift descended, and in a few moments all were united on the beach.</p>
- <p>The settlers went a short distance from the stranger, so as to leave him at liberty.</p>
- <p>He then made a few steps toward the sea, and his look brightened with extreme
  animation, but he did not make the slightest attempt to escape. He was gazing at
  the little waves which, broken by the islet, rippled on the sand.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThis is only the sea,\u201D observed Gideon Spilett, \u201Cand possibly\
  \ it does not inspire him with any wish to escape!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Harding, \u201Cwe must take him to the plateau, on\
  \ the border of the forest. There the experiment will be more conclusive.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CBesides, he could not run away,\u201D said Neb, \u201Csince the bridge\
  \ is raised.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh!\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cthat isn\u2019t a man to be troubled by\
  \ a stream like Creek Glycerine! He could cross it directly, at a single bound!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall soon see,\u201D Harding contented himself with replying, his\
  \ eyes not quitting those of his patient.</p>"
- <p>The latter was then led towards the mouth of the Mercy, and all climbing the
  left bank of the river, reached Prospect Heights.</p>
- <p>Arrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the forest, their
  foliage slightly agitated by the breeze, the stranger appeared greedily to drink
  in the penetrating odor which filled the atmosphere, and a long sigh escaped from
  his chest.</p>
- <p>The settlers kept behind him, ready to seize him if he made any movement to escape!</p>
- <p>And, indeed, the poor creature was on the point of springing into the creek which
  separated him from the forest, and his legs were bent for an instant as if for a
  spring, but almost immediately he stepped back, half sank down, and a large tear
  fell from his eyes.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAh!\u201D exclaimed Cyrus Harding, \u201Cyou have become a man again,\
  \ for you can weep!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 16</p>
- "<p>Yes! the unfortunate man had wept! Some recollection doubtless had flashed across\
  \ his brain, and to use Cyrus Harding\u2019s expression, by those tears he was once\
  \ more a man.</p>"
- <p>The colonists left him for some time on the plateau, and withdrew themselves
  to a short distance, so that he might feel himself free; but he did not think of
  profiting by this liberty, and Harding soon brought him back to Granite House. Two
  days after this occurrence, the stranger appeared to wish gradually to mingle with
  their common life. He evidently heard and understood, but no less evidently was
  he strangely determined not to speak to the colonists; for one evening, Pencroft,
  listening at the door of his room, heard these words escape from his lips:?</p>
- "<p>\u201CNo! here! I! never!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The sailor reported these words to his companions.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThere is some painful mystery there!\u201D said Harding.</p>"
- "<p>The stranger had begun to use the laboring tools, and he worked in the garden.\
  \ When he stopped in his work, as was often the case, he remained retired within\
  \ himself, but on the engineer\u2019s recommendation, they respected the reserve\
  \ which he apparently wished to keep. If one of the settlers approached him, he\
  \ drew back, and his chest heaved with sobs, as if overburdened!</p>"
- <p>Was it remorse that overwhelmed him thus? They were compelled to believe so,
  and Gideon Spilett could not help one day making this observation,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CIf he does not speak it is because he has, I fear, things too serious\
  \ to be told!\u201D</p>"
- <p>They must be patient and wait.</p>
- <p>A few days later, on the 3rd of November, the stranger, working on the plateau,
  had stopped, letting his spade drop to the ground, and Harding, who was observing
  him from a little distance, saw that tears were again flowing from his eyes. A sort
  of irresistible pity led him towards the unfortunate man, and he touched his arm
  lightly.</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friend!\u201D said he.</p>"
- <p>The stranger tried to avoid his look, and Cyrus Harding having endeavored to
  take his hand, he drew back quickly.</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friend,\u201D said Harding in a firmer voice, \u201Clook at me, I wish\
  \ it!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The stranger looked at the engineer, and seemed to be under his power, as a\
  \ subject under the influence of a mesmerist. He wished to run away. But then his\
  \ countenance suddenly underwent a transformation. His eyes flashed. Words struggled\
  \ to escape from his lips. He could no longer contain himself! At last he folded\
  \ his arms; then, in a hollow voice,?\u201CWho are you?\u201D he asked Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCastaways, like you,\u201D replied the engineer, whose emotion was deep.\
  \ \u201CWe have brought you here, among your fellow\u2011men.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy fellow\u2011men!.... I have none!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are in the midst of friends.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFriends!?for me! friends!\u201D exclaimed the stranger, hiding his face\
  \ in his hands. \u201CNo?never?leave me! leave me!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Then he rushed to the side of the plateau which overlooked the sea, and remained
  there a long time motionless.</p>
- <p>Harding rejoined his companions and related to them what had just happened.</p>
- "<p>\u201CYes! there is some mystery in that man\u2019s life,\u201D said Gideon\
  \ Spilett, \u201Cand it appears as if he had only re\u2011entered society by the\
  \ path of remorse.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI don\u2019t know what sort of a man we have brought here,\u201D said\
  \ the sailor. \u201CHe has secrets?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhich we will respect,\u201D interrupted Cyrus Harding quickly. \u201C\
  If he has committed any crime, he has most fearfully expiated it, and in our eyes\
  \ he is absolved.\u201D</p>"
- <p>For two hours the stranger remained alone on the shore, evidently under the influence
  of recollections which recalled all his past life?a melancholy life doubtless?and
  the colonists, without losing sight of him, did not attempt to disturb his solitude.
  However, after two hours, appearing to have formed a resolution, he came to find
  Cyrus Harding. His eyes were red with the tears he had shed, but he wept no longer.
  His countenance expressed deep humility. He appeared anxious, timorous, ashamed,
  and his eyes were constantly fixed on the ground.</p>
- "<p>\u201CSir,\u201D said he to Harding, \u201Cyour companions and you, are you\
  \ English?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D answered the engineer, \u201Cwe are Americans.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh!\u201D said the stranger, and he murmured, \u201CI prefer that!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd you, my friend?\u201D asked the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CEnglish,\u201D replied he hastily.</p>"
- <p>And as if these few words had been difficult to say, he retreated to the beach,
  where he walked up and down between the cascade and the mouth of the Mercy, in a
  state of extreme agitation.</p>
- <p>Then, passing one moment close to Herbert, he stopped and in a stifled voice,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat month?\u201D he asked.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDecember,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat year?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201C1866.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTwelve years! twelve years!\u201D he exclaimed.</p>"
- <p>Then he left him abruptly.</p>
- <p>Herbert reported to the colonists the questions and answers which had been made.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThis unfortunate man,\u201D observed Gideon Spilett, \u201Cwas no longer\
  \ acquainted with either months or years!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes!\u201D added Herbert, \u201Cand he had been twelve years already on\
  \ the islet when we found him there!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTwelve years!\u201D rejoined Harding. \u201CAh! twelve years of solitude,\
  \ after a wicked life, perhaps, may well impair a man\u2019s reason!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am induced to think,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cthat this man was not\
  \ wrecked on Tabor Island, but that in consequence of some crime he was left there.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou must be right, Pencroft,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Cand if\
  \ it is so it is not impossible that those who left him on the island may return\
  \ to fetch him some day!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd they will no longer find him,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut then,\u201D added Pencroft, \u201Cthey must return, and?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy friends,\u201D said Cyrus Harding, \u201Cdo not let us discuss this\
  \ question until we know more about it. I believe that the unhappy man has suffered,\
  \ that he has severely expiated his faults, whatever they may have been, and that\
  \ the wish to unburden himself stifles him. Do not let us press him to tell us his\
  \ history! He will tell it to us doubtless, and when we know it, we shall see what\
  \ course it will be best to follow. He alone besides can tell us, if he has more\
  \ than a hope, a certainty, of returning some day to his country, but I doubt it!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd why?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBecause that, in the event of his being sure of being delivered at a certain\
  \ time, he would have waited the hour of his deliverance and would not have thrown\
  \ this document into the sea. No, it is more probable that he was condemned to die\
  \ on that islet, and that he never expected to see his fellow\u2011creatures again!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D observed the sailor, \u201Cthere is one thing which I cannot\
  \ explain.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf this man had been left for twelve years on Tabor Island, one may well\
  \ suppose that he had been several years already in the wild state in which we found\
  \ him!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is probable,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt must then be many years since he wrote that document!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo doubt,\u201D and yet the document appears to have been recently written!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBesides, how do you know that the bottle which enclosed the document may\
  \ not have taken several years to come from Tabor Island to Lincoln Island?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is not absolutely impossible,\u201D replied the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMight it not have been a long time already on the coast of the island?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201Cfor it was still floating. We could\
  \ not even suppose that after it had stayed for any length of time on the shore,\
  \ it would have been swept off by the sea, for the south coast is all rocks, and\
  \ it would certainly have been smashed to pieces there!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is true,\u201D rejoined Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd then,\u201D continued the sailor, \u201Cif the document was several\
  \ years old, if it had been shut up in that bottle for several years, it would have\
  \ been injured by damp. Now, there is nothing of the kind, and it was found in a\
  \ perfect state of preservation.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The sailor\u2019s reasoning was very just, and pointed out an incomprehensible\
  \ fact, for the document appeared to have been recently written, when the colonists\
  \ found it in the bottle. Moreover, it gave the latitude and longitude of Tabor\
  \ Island correctly, which implied that its author had a more complete knowledge\
  \ of hydrography than could be expected of a common sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere is in this, again, something unaccountable,\u201D said the engineer,\
  \ \u201Cbut we will not urge our companion to speak. When he likes, my friends,\
  \ then we shall be ready to hear him!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>During the following days the stranger did not speak a word, and did not once\
  \ leave the precincts of the plateau. He worked away, without losing a moment, without\
  \ taking a minute\u2019s rest, but always in a retired place. At meal times he never\
  \ came to Granite House, although invited several times to do so, but contented\
  \ himself with eating a few raw vegetables. At nightfall he did not return to the\
  \ room assigned to him, but remained under some clump of trees, or when the weather\
  \ was bad crouched in some cleft of the rocks. Thus he lived in the same manner\
  \ as when he had no other shelter than the forests of Tabor Island, and as all persuasion\
  \ to induce him to improve his life was in vain, the colonists waited patiently.\
  \ And the time was near, when, as it seemed, almost involuntarily urged by his conscience,\
  \ a terrible confession escaped him.</p>"
- "<p>On the 10th of November, about eight o\u2019clock in the evening, as night was\
  \ coming on, the stranger appeared unexpectedly before the settlers, who were assembled\
  \ under the veranda. His eyes burned strangely, and he had quite resumed the wild\
  \ aspect of his worst days.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding and his companions were astounded on seeing that, overcome by\
  \ some terrible emotion, his teeth chattered like those of a person in a fever.\
  \ What was the matter with him? Was the sight of his fellow\u2011creatures insupportable\
  \ to him? Was he weary of this return to a civilized mode of existence? Was he pining\
  \ for his former savage life? It appeared so, as soon he was heard to express himself\
  \ in these incoherent sentences:?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy am I here?.... By what right have you dragged me from my islet?....\
  \ Do you think there could be any tie between you and me?.... Do you know who I\
  \ am?what I have done?why I was there?alone? And who told you that I was not abandoned\
  \ there?that I was not condemned to die there?.... Do you know my past?.... How\
  \ do you know that I have not stolen, murdered?that I am not a wretch?an accursed\
  \ being?only fit to live like a wild beast, far from all?speak?do you know it?\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The colonists listened without interrupting the miserable creature, from whom
  these broken confessions escaped, as it were, in spite of himself. Harding wishing
  to calm him, approached him, but he hastily drew back.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNo! no!\u201D he exclaimed; \u201Cone word only?am I free?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are free,\u201D answered the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFarewell, then!\u201D he cried, and fled like a madman.</p>"
- <p>Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert ran also towards the edge of the wood?but they returned
  alone.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe must let him alone!\u201D said Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe will never come back!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe will come back,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- <p>Many days passed; but Harding?was it a sort of presentiment??persisted in the
  fixed idea that sooner or later the unhappy man would return.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is the last revolt of his wild nature,\u201D said he, \u201Cwhich remorse\
  \ has touched, and which renewed solitude will terrify.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>In the meanwhile, works of all sorts were continued, as well on Prospect Heights\
  \ as at the corral, where Harding intended to build a farm. It is unnecessary to\
  \ say that the seeds collected by Herbert on Tabor Island had been carefully sown.\
  \ The plateau thus formed one immense kitchen\u2011garden, well laid out and carefully\
  \ tended, so that the arms of the settlers were never in want of work. There was\
  \ always something to be done. As the esculents increased in number, it became necessary\
  \ to enlarge the simple beds, which threatened to grow into regular fields and replace\
  \ the meadows. But grass abounded in other parts of the island, and there was no\
  \ fear of the onagers being obliged to go on short allowance. It was well worth\
  \ while, besides, to turn Prospect Heights into a kitchen\u2011garden, defended\
  \ by its deep belt of creeks, and to remove them to the meadows, which had no need\
  \ of protection against the depredations of quadrumana and quadrapeds.</p>"
- <p>On the 15th of November, the third harvest was gathered in. How wonderfully had
  the field increased in extent, since eighteen months ago, when the first grain of
  wheat was sown! The second crop of six hundred thousand grains produced this time
  four thousand bushels, or five hundred millions of grains!</p>
- <p>The colony was rich in corn, for ten bushels alone were sufficient for sowing
  every year to produce an ample crop for the food both of men and beasts. The harvest
  was completed, and the last fortnight of the month of November was devoted to the
  work of converting it into food for man. In fact, they had corn, but not flour,
  and the establishment of a mill was necessary. Cyrus Harding could have utilized
  the second fall which flowed into the Mercy to establish his motive power, the first
  being already occupied with moving the felting mill, but, after some consultation,
  it was decided that a simple windmill should be built on Prospect Heights. The building
  of this presented no more difficulty than the building of the former, and it was
  moreover certain that there would be no want of wind on the plateau, exposed as
  it was to the sea breezes.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNot to mention,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cthat the windmill will be more\
  \ lively and will have a good effect in the landscape!\u201D</p>"
- <p>They set to work by choosing timber for the frame and machinery of the mill.
  Some large stones, found at the north of the lake, could be easily transformed into
  millstones, and as to the sails, the inexhaustible case of the balloon furnished
  the necessary material.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding made his model, and the site of the mill was chosen a little to\
  \ the right of the poultry\u2011yard, near the shore of the lake. The frame was\
  \ to rest on a pivot supported with strong timbers, so that it could turn with all\
  \ the machinery it contained according as the wind required it. The work advanced\
  \ rapidly. Neb and Pencroft had become very skilful carpenters, and had nothing\
  \ to do but to copy the models provided by the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>Soon a sort of cylindrical box, in shape like a pepper\u2011pot, with a pointed\
  \ roof, rose on the spot chosen. The four frames which formed the sails had been\
  \ firmly fixed in the center beam, so as to form a certain angle with it, and secured\
  \ with iron clamps. As to the different parts of the internal mechanism, the box\
  \ destined to contain the two millstones, the fixed stone and the moving stone,\
  \ the hopper, a sort of large square trough, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom,\
  \ which would allow the grain to fall on the stones, the oscillating spout intended\
  \ to regulate the passing of the grain, and lastly the bolting machine, which by\
  \ the operation of sifting, separates the bran from the flour, were made without\
  \ difficulty. The tools were good, and the work not difficult, for in reality, the\
  \ machinery of a mill is very simple. This was only a question of time.</p>"
- <p>Every one had worked at the construction of the mill, and on the 1st of December
  it was finished. As usual, Pencroft was delighted with his work, and had no doubt
  that the apparatus was perfect.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNow for a good wind,\u201D said he, \u201Cand we shall grind our first\
  \ harvest splendidly!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA good wind, certainly,\u201D answered the engineer, \u201Cbut not too\
  \ much, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPooh! our mill would only go the faster!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere is no need for it to go so very fast,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.\
  \ \u201CIt is known by experience that the greatest quantity of work is performed\
  \ by a mill when the number of turns made by the sails in a minute is six times\
  \ the number of feet traversed by the wind in a second. A moderate breeze, which\
  \ passes over twenty\u2011four feet to the second, will give sixteen turns to the\
  \ sails during a minute, and there is no need of more.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CExactly!\u201D cried Herbert, \u201Ca fine breeze is blowing from the\
  \ northeast, which will soon do our business for us.\u201D</p>"
- <p>There was no reason for delaying the inauguration of the mill, for the settlers
  were eager to taste the first piece of bread in Lincoln Island. On this morning
  two or three bushels of wheat were ground, and the next day at breakfast a magnificent
  loaf, a little heavy perhaps, although raised with yeast, appeared on the table
  at Granite House. Every one munched away at it with a pleasure which may be easily
  understood.</p>
- <p>In the meanwhile, the stranger had not reappeared. Several times Gideon Spilett
  and Herbert searched the forest in the neighborhood of Granite House, without meeting
  or finding any trace of him. They became seriously uneasy at this prolonged absence.
  Certainly, the former savage of Tabor island could not be perplexed how to live
  in the forest, abounding in game, but was it not to be feared that he had resumed
  his habits, and that this freedom would revive in him his wild instincts? However,
  Harding, by a sort of presentiment, doubtless, always persisted in saying that the
  fugitive would return.</p>
- "<p>\u201CYes, he will return!\u201D he repeated with a confidence which his companions\
  \ could not share. \u201CWhen this unfortunate man was on Tabor Island, he knew\
  \ himself to be alone! Here, he knows that fellow\u2011men are awaiting him! Since\
  \ he has partially spoken of his past life, the poor penitent will return to tell\
  \ the whole, and from that day he will belong to us!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The event justified Cyrus Harding\u2019s predictions. On the 3rd of December,\
  \ Herbert had left the plateau to go and fish on the southern bank of the lake.\
  \ He was unarmed, and till then had never taken any precautions for defense, as\
  \ dangerous animals had not shown themselves on that part of the island.</p>"
- "<p>Meanwhile, Pencroft and Neb were working in the poultry\u2011yard, while Harding\
  \ and the reporter were occupied at the Chimneys in making soda, the store of soap\
  \ being exhausted.</p>"
- <p>Suddenly cries resounded,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CHelp! help!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding and the reporter, being at too great a distance, had not been\
  \ able to hear the shouts. Pencroft and Neb, leaving the poultry\u2011yard in all\
  \ haste, rushed towards the lake.</p>"
- <p>But before then, the stranger, whose presence at this place no one had suspected,
  crossed Creek Glycerine, which separated the plateau from the forest, and bounded
  up the opposite bank.</p>
- <p>Herbert was there face to face with a fierce jaguar, similar to the one which
  had been killed on Reptile End. Suddenly surprised, he was standing with his back
  against a tree, while the animal gathering itself together was about to spring.</p>
- <p>But the stranger, with no other weapon than a knife, rushed on the formidable
  animal, who turned to meet this new adversary.</p>
- "<p>The struggle was short. The stranger possessed immense strength and activity.\
  \ He seized the jaguar\u2019s throat with one powerful hand, holding it as in a\
  \ vise, without heeding the beast\u2019s claws which tore his flesh, and with the\
  \ other he plunged his knife into its heart.</p>"
- <p>The jaguar fell. The stranger kicked away the body, and was about to fly at the
  moment when the settlers arrived on the field of battle, but Herbert, clinging to
  him, cried,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CNo, no! you shall not go!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Harding advanced towards the stranger, who frowned when he saw him approaching.
  The blood flowed from his shoulder under his torn shirt, but he took no notice of
  it.</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friend,\u201D said Cyrus Harding, \u201Cwe have just contracted a debt\
  \ of gratitude to you. To save our boy you have risked your life!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy life!\u201D murmured the stranger. \u201CWhat is that worth? Less than\
  \ nothing!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are wounded?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is no matter.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWill you give me your hand?\u201D</p>"
- <p>And as Herbert endeavored to seize the hand which had just saved him, the stranger
  folded his arms, his chest heaved, his look darkened, and he appeared to wish to
  escape, but making a violent effort over himself, and in an abrupt tone,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWho are you?\u201D he asked, \u201Cand what do you claim to be to me?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>It was the colonists\u2019 history which he thus demanded, and for the first\
  \ time. Perhaps this history recounted, he would tell his own.</p>"
- <p>In a few words Harding related all that had happened since their departure from
  Richmond; how they had managed, and what resources they now had at their disposal.</p>
- <p>The stranger listened with extreme attention.</p>
- <p>Then the engineer told who they all were, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft,
  Neb, himself, and, he added, that the greatest happiness they had felt since their
  arrival in Lincoln Island was on the return of the vessel from Tabor Island, when
  they had been able to include among them a new companion.</p>
- "<p>At these words the stranger\u2019s face flushed, his head sunk on his breast,\
  \ and confusion was depicted on his countenance.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd now that you know us,\u201D added Cyrus Harding, \u201Cwill you give\
  \ us your hand?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied the stranger in a hoarse voice; \u201Cno! You are honest\
  \ men! And I?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 17</p>
- "<p>These last words justified the colonists\u2019 presentiment. There had been\
  \ some mournful past, perhaps expiated in the sight of men, but from which his conscience\
  \ had not yet absolved him. At any rate the guilty man felt remorse, he repented,\
  \ and his new friends would have cordially pressed the hand which they sought; but\
  \ he did not feel himself worthy to extend it to honest men! However, after the\
  \ scene with the jaguar, he did not return to the forest, and from that day did\
  \ not go beyond the enclosure of Granite House.</p>"
- <p>What was the mystery of his life? Would the stranger one day speak of it? Time
  alone could show. At any rate, it was agreed that his secret should never be asked
  from him, and that they would live with him as if they suspected nothing.</p>
- "<p>For some days their life continued as before. Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett\
  \ worked together, sometimes chemists, sometimes experimentalists. The reporter\
  \ never left the engineer except to hunt with Herbert, for it would not have been\
  \ prudent to allow the lad to ramble alone in the forest; and it was very necessary\
  \ to be on their guard. As to Neb and Pencroft, one day at the stables and poultry\u2011\
  yard, another at the corral, without reckoning work in Granite House, they were\
  \ never in want of employment.</p>"
- <p>The stranger worked alone, and he had resumed his usual life, never appearing
  at meals, sleeping under the trees in the plateau, never mingling with his companions.
  It really seemed as if the society of those who had saved him was insupportable
  to him!</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut then,\u201D observed Pencroft, \u201Cwhy did he entreat the help of\
  \ his fellow\u2011creatures? Why did he throw that paper into the sea?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe will tell us why,\u201D invariably replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhen?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps sooner than you think, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- <p>And, indeed, the day of confession was near.</p>
- "<p>On the 10th of December, a week after his return to Granite House, Harding saw\
  \ the stranger approaching, who, in a calm voice and humble tone, said to him: \u201C\
  Sir, I have a request to make of you.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSpeak,\u201D answered the engineer, \u201Cbut first let me ask you a question.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>At these words the stranger reddened, and was on the point of withdrawing. Cyrus
  Harding understood what was passing in the mind of the guilty man, who doubtless
  feared that the engineer would interrogate him on his past life.</p>
- <p>Harding held him back.</p>
- "<p>\u201CComrade,\u201D said he, \u201Cwe are not only your companions but your\
  \ friends. I wish you to believe that, and now I will listen to you.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The stranger pressed his hand over his eyes. He was seized with a sort of trembling,
  and remained a few moments without being able to articulate a word.</p>
- "<p>\u201CSir,\u201D said he at last, \u201CI have come to beg you to grant me a\
  \ favor.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou have, four or five miles from here, a corral for your domesticated\
  \ animals. These animals need to be taken care of. Will you allow me to live there\
  \ with them?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding gazed at the unfortunate man for a few moments with a feeling of
  deep commiseration; then,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friend,\u201D said he, \u201Cthe corral has only stables hardly fit\
  \ for animals.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt will be good enough for me, sir.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy friend,\u201D answered Harding, \u201Cwe will not constrain you in\
  \ anything. You wish to live at the corral, so be it. You will, however, be always\
  \ welcome at Granite House. But since you wish to live at the corral we will make\
  \ the necessary arrangements for your being comfortably established there.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNever mind that, I shall do very well.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy friend,\u201D answered Harding, who always intentionally made use of\
  \ this cordial appellation, \u201Cyou must let us judge what it will be best to\
  \ do in this respect.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThank you, sir,\u201D replied the stranger as he withdrew.</p>"
- <p>The engineer then made known to his companions the proposal which had been made
  to him, and it was agreed that they should build a wooden house at the corral, which
  they would make as comfortable as possible.</p>
- <p>That very day the colonists repaired to the corral with the necessary tools,
  and a week had not passed before the house was ready to receive its tenant. It was
  built about twenty feet from the sheds, and from there it was easy to overlook the
  flock of sheep, which then numbered more than eighty. Some furniture, a bed, table,
  bench, cupboard, and chest were manufactured, and a gun, ammunition, and tools were
  carried to the corral.</p>
- <p>The stranger, however, had seen nothing of his new dwelling, and he had allowed
  the settlers to work there without him, while he occupied himself on the plateau,
  wishing, doubtless, to put the finishing stroke to his work. Indeed, thanks to him,
  all the ground was dug up and ready to be sowed when the time came.</p>
- <p>It was on the 20th of December that all the arrangements at the corral were completed.
  The engineer announced to the stranger that his dwelling was ready to receive him,
  and the latter replied that he would go and sleep there that very evening.</p>
- "<p>On this evening the colonists were gathered in the diningroom of Granite House.\
  \ It was then eight o\u2019clock, the hour at which their companion was to leave\
  \ them. Not wishing to trouble him by their presence, and thus imposing on him the\
  \ necessity of saying farewells which might perhaps be painful to him, they had\
  \ left him alone and ascended to Granite House.</p>"
- <p>Now, they had been talking in the room for a few minutes, when a light knock
  was heard at the door. Almost immediately the stranger entered, and without any
  preamble,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CGentlemen,\u201D said he, \u201Cbefore I leave you, it is right that you\
  \ should know my history. I will tell it you.\u201D</p>"
- <p>These simple words profoundly impressed Cyrus Harding and his companions. The
  engineer rose.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe ask you nothing, my friend,\u201D said he; \u201Cit is your right to\
  \ be silent.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is my duty to speak.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSit down, then.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, I will stand.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe are ready to hear you,\u201D replied Harding.</p>"
- <p>The stranger remained standing in a corner of the room, a little in the shade.
  He was bareheaded, his arms folded across his chest, and it was in this posture
  that in a hoarse voice, speaking like some one who obliges himself to speak, he
  gave the following recital, which his auditors did not once interrupt:?</p>
- "<p>\u201COn the 20th of December, 1854, a steam\u2011yacht, belonging to a Scotch\
  \ nobleman, Lord Glenarvan, anchored off Cape Bernouilli, on the western coast of\
  \ Australia, in the thirty\u2011seventh parallel. On board this yacht were Lord\
  \ Glenarvan and his wife, a major in the English army, a French geographer, a young\
  \ girl, and a young boy. These two last were the children of Captain Grant, whose\
  \ ship, the ?Britannia,\u2019 had been lost, crew and cargo, a year before. The\
  \ ?Duncan\u2019 was commanded by Captain John Mangles, and manned by a crew of fifteen\
  \ men.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis is the reason the yacht at this time lay off the coast of Australia.\
  \ Six months before, a bottle, enclosing a document written in English, German,\
  \ and French, had been found in the Irish Sea, and picked up by the ?Duncan.\u2019\
  \ This document stated in substance that there still existed three survivors from\
  \ the wreck of the ?Britannia,\u2019 that these survivors were Captain Grant and\
  \ two of his men, and that they had found refuge on some land, of which the document\
  \ gave the latitude, but of which the longitude, effaced by the sea, was no longer\
  \ legible.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis latitude was 37deg 11\u2019 south; therefore, the longitude being\
  \ unknown, if they followed the thirty\u2011seventh parallel over continents and\
  \ seas, they would be certain to reach the spot inhabited by Captain Grant and his\
  \ two companions. The English Admiralty having hesitated to undertake this search,\
  \ Lord Glenarvan resolved to attempt everything to find the captain. He communicated\
  \ with Mary and Robert Grant, who joined him. The ?Duncan\u2019 yacht was equipped\
  \ for the distant voyage, in which the nobleman\u2019s family and the captain\u2019\
  s children wished to take part, and the ?Duncan,\u2019 leaving Glasgow, proceeded\
  \ towards the Atlantic, passed through the Straits of Magellan, and ascended the\
  \ Pacific as far as Patagonia, where, according to a previous interpretation of\
  \ the document, they supposed that Captain Grant was a prisoner among the Indians.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe ?Duncan\u2019 disembarked her passengers on the western coast of Patagonia,\
  \ and sailed to pick them up again on the eastern coast at Cape Corrientes. Lord\
  \ Glenarvan traversed Patagonia, following the thirty\u2011seventh parallel, and\
  \ having found no trace of the captain, he re\u2011embarked on the 13th of November,\
  \ so as to pursue his search through the Ocean.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAfter having unsuccessfully visited the islands of Tristan d\u2019Acunha\
  \ and Amsterdam, situated in her course, the ?Duncan,\u2019 as I have said, arrived\
  \ at Cape Bernouilli, on the Australian coast, on the 20th of December, 1854.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt was Lord Glenarvan\u2019s intention to traverse Australia as he had\
  \ traversed America, and he disembarked. A few miles from the coast was established\
  \ a farm, belonging to an Irishman, who offered hospitality to the travelers. Lord\
  \ Glenarvan made known to the Irishman the cause which had brought him to these\
  \ parts, and asked if he knew whether a three\u2011masted English vessel, the ?Britannia,\u2019\
  \ had been lost less than two years before on the west coast of Australia.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe Irishman had never heard of this wreck, but, to the great surprise\
  \ of the bystanders, one of his servants came forward and said,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201C?My lord, praise and thank God! If Captain Grant is still living, he is\
  \ living on the Australian shores.\u2019</p>"
- "<p>\u201C?Who are you?\u2019 asked Lord Glenarvan.</p>"
- "<p>\u201C?A Scotchman like yourself, my lord,\u2019 replied the man; ?I am one\
  \ of Captain Grant\u2019s crew?one of the castaways of the \u201CBritannia.\u201C\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis man was called Ayrton. He was, in fact, the boatswain\u2019s mate\
  \ of the ?Britannia,\u2019 as his papers showed. But, separated from Captain Grant\
  \ at the moment when the ship struck upon the rocks, he had till then believed that\
  \ the captain with all his crew had perished, and that he, Ayrton, was the sole\
  \ survivor of the ?Britannia.\u2019</p>"
- "<p>\u201C?Only,\u2019 he added, ?it was not on the west coast, but on the east\
  \ coast of Australia that the vessel was lost, and if Captain Grant is still living,\
  \ as his document indicates, he is a prisoner among the natives, and it is on the\
  \ other coast that he must be looked for.\u2019</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis man spoke in a frank voice and with a confident look; his words could\
  \ not be doubted. The Irishman, in whose service he had been for more than a year,\
  \ answered for his trustworthiness. Lord Glenarvan, therefore, believed in the fidelity\
  \ of this man and, by his advice, resolved to cross Australia, following the thirty\u2011\
  seventh parallel. Lord Glenarvan, his wife, the two children, the major, the Frenchman,\
  \ Captain Mangles, and a few sailors composed the little band under the command\
  \ of Ayrton, while the ?Duncan,\u2019 under charge of the mate, Tom Austin, proceeded\
  \ to Melbourne, there to await Lord Glenarvan\u2019s instructions.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey set out on the 23rd of December, 1854.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is time to say that Ayrton was a traitor. He was, indeed, the boatswain\u2019\
  s mate of the ?Britannia,\u2019 but, after some dispute with his captain, he endeavored\
  \ to incite the crew to mutiny and seize the ship, and Captain Grant had landed\
  \ him, on the 8th of April, 1852, on the west coast of Australia, and then sailed,\
  \ leaving him there, as was only just.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTherefore this wretched man knew nothing of the wreck of the ?Britannia\u2019\
  ; he had just heard of it from Glenarvan\u2019s account. Since his abandonment,\
  \ he had become, under the name of Ben Joyce, the leader of the escaped convicts;\
  \ and if he boldly maintained that the wreck had taken place on the east coast,\
  \ and led Lord Glenarvan to proceed in that direction, it was that he hoped to separate\
  \ him from his ship, seize the ?Duncan,\u2019 and make the yacht a pirate in the\
  \ Pacific.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Here the stranger stopped for a moment. His voice trembled, but he continued,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe expedition set out and proceeded across Australia. It was inevitably\
  \ unfortunate, since Ayrton, or Ben Joyce, as he may be called, guided it, sometimes\
  \ preceded, sometimes followed by his band of convicts, who had been told what they\
  \ had to do.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMeanwhile, the ?Duncan\u2019 had been sent to Melbourne for repairs. It\
  \ was necessary, then, to get Lord Glenarvan to order her to leave Melbourne and\
  \ go to the east coast of Australia, where it would be easy to seize her. After\
  \ having led the expedition near enough to the coast, in the midst of vast forests\
  \ with no resources, Ayrton obtained a letter, which he was charged to carry to\
  \ the mate of the ?Duncan\u2019?a letter which ordered the yacht to repair immediately\
  \ to the east coast, to Twofold Bay, that is to say a few days\u2019 journey from\
  \ the place where the expedition had stopped. It was there that Ayrton had agreed\
  \ to meet his accomplices, and two days after gaining possession of the letter,\
  \ he arrived at Melbourne.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSo far the villain had succeeded in his wicked design. He would be able\
  \ to take the ?Duncan\u2019 into Twofold Bay, where it would be easy for the convicts\
  \ to seize her, and her crew massacred, Ben Joyce would become master of the seas.\
  \ But it pleased God to prevent the accomplishment of these terrible projects.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAyrton, arrived at Melbourne, delivered the letter to the mate, Tom Austin,\
  \ who read it and immediately set sail, but judge of Ayrton\u2019s rage and disappointment,\
  \ when the next day he found that the mate was taking the vessel, not to the east\
  \ coast of Australia, to Twofold Bay, but to the east coast of New Zealand. He wished\
  \ to stop him, but Austin showed him the letter!... And indeed, by a providential\
  \ error of the French geographer, who had written the letter, the east coast of\
  \ New Zealand was mentioned as the place of destination.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAll Ayrton\u2019s plans were frustrated! He became outrageous. They put\
  \ him in irons. He was then taken to the coast of New Zealand, not knowing what\
  \ would become of his accomplices, or what would become of Lord Glenarvan.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe ?Duncan\u2019 cruised about on this coast until the 3rd of March.\
  \ On that day Ayrton heard the report of guns. The guns on the ?Duncan\u2019 were\
  \ being fired, and soon Lord Glenarvan and his companions came on board.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis is what had happened.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAfter a thousand hardships, a thousand dangers, Lord Glenarvan had accomplished\
  \ his journey, and arrived on the east coast of Australia, at Twofold Bay. ?No \u201C\
  Duncan!\u2019 He telegraphed to Melbourne. They answered, \u201CDuncan\u201D sailed\
  \ on the 18th instant. Destination unknown.\u2019</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLord Glenarvan could only arrive at one conclusion; that his honest yacht\
  \ had fallen into the hands of Ben Joyce, and had become a pirate vessel!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHowever, Lord Glenarvan would not give up. He was a bold and generous\
  \ man. He embarked in a merchant vessel, sailed to the west coast of New Zealand,\
  \ traversed it along the thirty\u2011seventh parallel, without finding any trace\
  \ of Captain Grant; but on the other side, to his great surprise, and by the will\
  \ of Heaven, he found the ?Duncan,\u2019 under command of the mate, who had been\
  \ waiting for him for five weeks!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis was on the 3rd of March, 1855. Lord Glenarvan was now on board the\
  \ ?Duncan,\u2019 but Ayrton was there also. He appeared before the nobleman, who\
  \ wished to extract from him all that the villain knew about Captain Grant. Ayrton\
  \ refused to speak. Lord Glenarvan then told him, that at the first port they put\
  \ into, he would be delivered up to the English authorities. Ayrton remained mute.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe ?Duncan\u2019 continued her voyage along the thirty\u2011seventh parallel.\
  \ In the meanwhile, Lady Glenarvan undertook to vanquish the resistance of the ruffian.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt last, her influence prevailed, and Ayrton, in exchange for what he\
  \ could tell, proposed that Lord Glenarvan should leave him on some island in the\
  \ Pacific, instead of giving him up to the English authorities. Lord Glenarvan,\
  \ resolving to do anything to obtain information about Captain Grant, consented.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAyrton then related all his life, and it was certain that he knew nothing\
  \ from the day on which Captain Grant had landed him on the Australian coast.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNevertheless, Lord Glenarvan kept the promise which he had given. The\
  \ ?Duncan\u2019 continued her voyage and arrived at Tabor Island. It was there that\
  \ Ayrton was to be landed, and it was there also that, by a veritable miracle, they\
  \ found Captain Grant and two men, exactly on the thirty\u2011seventh parallel.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe convict, then, went to take their place on this desert islet, and\
  \ at the moment he left the yacht these words were pronounced by Lord Glenarvan:?</p>"
- "<p>\u201C?Here, Ayrton, you will be far from any land, and without any possible\
  \ communication with your fellow\u2011creatures. You cannot escape from this islet\
  \ on which the ?Duncan\u2019 leaves you. You will be alone, under the eye of a God\
  \ who reads the depths of the heart, but you will be neither lost nor forgotten,\
  \ as was Captain Grant. Unworthy as you are to be remembered by men, men will remember\
  \ you. I know where you are Ayrton, and I know where to find you. I will never forget\
  \ it!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd the ?Duncan,\u2019 making sail, soon disappeared. This was 18th of\
  \ March, 1855.</p>"
- <p>     (The events which have just been briefly related are taken</p>
- <p>     from a work which some of our readers have no doubt read,</p>
- "<p>     and which is entitled, \u201CCaptain Grant\u2019s children.\u201D They\
  \ will</p>"
- <p>     remark on this occasion, as well as later, some discrepancy</p>
- <p>     in the dates; but later again, they will understand why the</p>
- <p>     real dates were not at first given.)</p>
- "<p>\u201CAyrton was alone, but he had no want of either ammunition, weapons, tools,\
  \ or seeds.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt his, the convict\u2019s disposal, was the house built by honest Captain\
  \ Grant. He had only to live and expiate in solitude the crimes which he had committed.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGentlemen, he repented, he was ashamed of his crimes and was very miserable!\
  \ He said to himself, that if men came some day to take him from that islet, he\
  \ must be worthy to return among them! How he suffered, that wretched man! How he\
  \ labored to recover himself by work! How he prayed to be reformed by prayer! For\
  \ two years, three years, this went on, but Ayrton, humbled by solitude, always\
  \ looking for some ship to appear on the horizon, asking himself if the time of\
  \ expiation would soon be complete, suffered as none other suffered! Oh! how dreadful\
  \ was this solitude, to a heart tormented by remorse!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut doubtless Heaven had not sufficiently punished this unhappy man, for\
  \ he felt that he was gradually becoming a savage! He felt that brutishness was\
  \ gradually gaining on him!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe could not say if it was after two or three years of solitude, but at\
  \ last he became the miserable creature you found!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI have no need to tell you, gentlemen, that Ayrton, Ben Joyce, and I,\
  \ are the same.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions rose at the end of this account. It is impossible
  to say how much they were moved! What misery, grief, and despair lay revealed before
  them!</p>
- "<p>\u201CAyrton,\u201D said Harding, rising, \u201Cyou have been a great criminal,\
  \ but Heaven must certainly think that you have expiated your crimes! That has been\
  \ proved by your having been brought again among your fellow\u2011creatures. Ayrton,\
  \ you are forgiven! And now you will be our companion?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Ayrton drew back.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHere is my hand!\u201D said the engineer.</p>"
- <p>Ayrton grasped the hand which Harding extended to him, and great tears fell from
  his eyes.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWill you live with us?\u201D asked Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Harding, leave me some time longer,\u201D replied Ayrton, \u201C\
  leave me alone in the hut in the corral!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAs you like, Ayrton,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding. Ayrton was going to\
  \ withdraw, when the engineer addressed one more question to him:?</p>"
- "<p>\u201COne word more, my friend. Since it was your intention to live alone, why\
  \ did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA document?\u201D repeated Ayrton, who did not appear to know what he\
  \ meant.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, the document which we found enclosed in a bottle, giving us the exact\
  \ position of Tabor Island!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Ayrton passed his hand over his brow, then after having thought, \u201CI never\
  \ threw any document into the sea!\u201D he answered.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNever?\u201D exclaimed Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNever!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And Ayrton, bowing, reached the door and departed.</p>
- <p>Chapter 18</p>
- "<p>\u201CPoor man!\u201D said Herbert, who had rushed to the door, but returned,\
  \ having seen Ayrton slide down the rope on the lift and disappear in the darkness.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe will come back,\u201D said Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCome, now, captain,\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201Cwhat does that mean?\
  \ What! wasn\u2019t it Ayrton who threw that bottle into the sea? Who was it then?\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Certainly, if ever a question was necessary to be made, it was that one!</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt was he,\u201D answered Neb, \u201Conly the unhappy man was half\u2011\
  mad.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes!\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cand he was no longer conscious of what\
  \ he was doing.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt can only be explained in that way, my friends,\u201D replied Harding\
  \ quickly, \u201Cand I understand now how Ayrton was able to point out exactly the\
  \ situation of Tabor Island, since the events which had preceded his being left\
  \ on the island had made it known to him.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHowever,\u201D observed Pencroft, \u201Cif he was not yet a brute when\
  \ he wrote that document, and if he threw it into the sea seven or eight years ago,\
  \ how is it that the paper has not been injured by damp?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat proves,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding, \u201Cthat Ayrton was deprived\
  \ of intelligence at a more recent time than he thinks.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COf course it must be so,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cwithout that the\
  \ fact would be unaccountable.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CUnaccountable indeed,\u201D answered the engineer, who did not appear\
  \ desirous to prolong the conversation.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut has Ayrton told the truth?\u201D asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied the reporter. \u201CThe story which he has told is\
  \ true in every point. I remember quite well the account in the newspapers of the\
  \ yacht expedition undertaken by Lord Glenarvan, and its result.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAyrton has told the truth,\u201D added Harding. \u201CDo not doubt it,\
  \ Pencroft, for it was painful to him. People tell the truth when they accuse themselves\
  \ like that!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The next day?the 21st of December?the colonists descended to the beach, and having
  climbed the plateau they found nothing of Ayrton. He had reached his house in the
  corral during the night and the settlers judged it best not to agitate him by their
  presence. Time would doubtless perform what sympathy had been unable to accomplish.</p>
- <p>Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb resumed their ordinary occupations. On this day the
  same work brought Harding and the reporter to the workshop at the Chimneys.</p>
- "<p>\u201CDo you know, my dear Cyrus,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cthat the\
  \ explanation you gave yesterday on the subject of the bottle has not satisfied\
  \ me at all! How can it be supposed that the unfortunate man was able to write that\
  \ document and throw the bottle into the sea without having the slightest recollection\
  \ of it?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNor was it he who threw it in, my dear Spilett.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou think then?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI think nothing, I know nothing!\u201D interrupted Cyrus Harding. \u201C\
  I am content to rank this incident among those which I have not been able to explain\
  \ to this day!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIndeed, Cyrus,\u201D said Spilett, \u201Cthese things are incredible!\
  \ Your rescue, the case stranded on the sand, Top\u2019s adventure, and lastly this\
  \ bottle... Shall we never have the answer to these enigmas?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes!\u201D replied the engineer quickly, \u201Cyes, even if I have to\
  \ penetrate into the bowels of this island!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CChance will perhaps give us the key to this mystery!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CChance! Spilett! I do not believe in chance, any more than I believe in\
  \ mysteries in this world. There is a reason for everything unaccountable which\
  \ has happened here, and that reason I shall discover. But in the meantime we must\
  \ work and observe.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The month of January arrived. The year 1867 commenced. The summer occupations
  were assiduously continued. During the days which followed, Herbert and Spilett
  having gone in the direction of the corral, ascertained that Ayrton had taken possession
  of the habitation which had been prepared for him. He busied himself with the numerous
  flock confided to his care, and spared his companions the trouble of coming every
  two or three days to visit the corral. Nevertheless, in order not to leave Ayrton
  in solitude for too long a time, the settlers often paid him a visit.</p>
- <p>It was not unimportant either, in consequence of some suspicions entertained
  by the engineer and Gideon Spilett, that this part of the island should be subject
  to a surveillance of some sort, and that Ayrton, if any incident occurred unexpectedly,
  should not neglect to inform the inhabitants of Granite House of it.</p>
- "<p>Nevertheless it might happen that something would occur which it would be necessary\
  \ to bring rapidly to the engineer\u2019s knowledge. Independently of facts bearing\
  \ on the mystery of Lincoln Island, many others might happen, which would call for\
  \ the prompt interference of the colonists,?such as the sighting of a vessel, a\
  \ wreck on the western coast, the possible arrival of pirates, etc.</p>"
- <p>Therefore Cyrus Harding resolved to put the corral in instantaneous communication
  with Granite House.</p>
- <p>It was on the 10th of January that he made known his project to his companions.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhy! how are you going to manage that, captain?\u201D asked Pencroft.\
  \ \u201CDo you by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CExactly so,\u201D answered the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CElectric?\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CElectric,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding. \u201CWe have all the necessary\
  \ materials for making a battery, and the most difficult thing will be to stretch\
  \ the wires, but by means of a drawplate I think we shall manage it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, after that,\u201D returned the sailor, \u201CI shall never despair\
  \ of seeing ourselves some day rolling along on a railway!\u201D</p>"
- <p>They then set to work, beginning with the most difficult thing, for, if they
  failed in that, it would be useless to manufacture the battery and other accessories.</p>
- "<p>The iron of Lincoln Island, as has been said, was of excellent quality, and\
  \ consequently very fit for being drawn out. Harding commenced by manufacturing\
  \ a drawplate, that is to say, a plate of steel, pierced with conical holes of different\
  \ sizes, which would successively bring the wire to the wished\u2011for tenacity.\
  \ This piece of steel, after having been tempered, was fixed in as firm a way as\
  \ possible in a solid framework planted in the ground, only a few feet from the\
  \ great fall, the motive power of which the engineer intended to utilize. In fact\
  \ as the fulling\u2011mill was there, although not then in use, its beam moved with\
  \ extreme power would serve to stretch out the wire by rolling it round itself.\
  \ It was a delicate operation, and required much care. The iron, prepared previously\
  \ in long thin rods, the ends of which were sharpened with the file, having been\
  \ introduced into the largest hole of the drawplate, was drawn out by the beam which\
  \ wound it round itself, to a length of twenty\u2011five or thirty feet, then unrolled,\
  \ and the same operation was performed successively through the holes of a less\
  \ size. Finally, the engineer obtained wires from forty to fifty feet long, which\
  \ could be easily fastened together and stretched over the distance of five miles,\
  \ which separated the corral from the bounds of Granite House.</p>"
- <p>It did not take more than a few days to perform this work, and indeed as soon
  as the machine had been commenced, Cyrus Harding left his companions to follow the
  trade of wiredrawers, and occupied himself with manufacturing his battery.</p>
- <p>It was necessary to obtain a battery with a constant current. It is known that
  the elements of modern batteries are generally composed of retort coal, zinc, and
  copper. Copper was absolutely wanting to the engineer, who, notwithstanding all
  his researches, had never been able to find any trace of it in Lincoln Island, and
  was therefore obliged to do without it. Retort coal, that is to say, the hard graphite
  which is found in the retorts of gas manufactories, after the coal has been dehydrogenized,
  could have been obtained, but it would have been necessary to establish a special
  apparatus, involving great labor. As to zinc, it may be remembered that the case
  found at Flotsam Point was lined with this metal, which could not be better utilized
  than for this purpose.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding, after mature consideration, decided to manufacture a very simple
  battery, resembling as nearly as possible that invented by Becquerel in 1820, and
  in which zinc only is employed. The other substances, azotic acid and potash, were
  all at his disposal.</p>
- <p>The way in which the battery was composed was as follows, and the results were
  to be attained by the reaction of acid and potash on each other. A number of glass
  bottles were made and filled with azotic acid. The engineer corked them by means
  of a stopper through which passed a glass tube, bored at its lower extremity, and
  intended to be plunged into the acid by means of a clay stopper secured by a rag.
  Into this tube, through its upper extremity, he poured a solution of potash, previously
  obtained by burning and reducing to ashes various plants, and in this way the acid
  and potash could act on each other through the clay.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding then took two slips of zinc, one of which was plunged into azotic
  acid, the other into a solution of potash. A current was immediately produced, which
  was transmitted from the slip of zinc in the bottle to that in the tube, and the
  two slips having been connected by a metallic wire the slip in the tube became the
  positive pole, and that in the bottle the negative pole of the apparatus. Each bottle,
  therefore, produced as many currents as united would be sufficient to produce all
  the phenomena of the electric telegraph. Such was the ingenious and very simple
  apparatus constructed by Cyrus Harding, an apparatus which would allow them to establish
  a telegraphic communication between Granite House and the corral.</p>
- <p>On the 6th of February was commenced the planting along the road to the corral,
  of posts furnished with glass insulators, and intended to support the wire. A few
  days after, the wire was extended, ready to produce the electric current at a rate
  of twenty thousand miles a second.</p>
- <p>Two batteries had been manufactured, one for Granite House, the other for the
  corral; for if it was necessary the corral should be able to communicate with Granite
  House it might also be useful that Granite House should be able to communicate with
  the corral.</p>
- <p>As to the receiver and manipulator, they were very simple. At the two stations
  the wire was wound round a magnet, that is to say, round a piece of soft iron surrounded
  with a wire. The communication was thus established between the two poles; the current,
  starting from the positive pole, traversed the wire, passed through the magnet which
  was temporarily magnetized, and returned through the earth to the negative pole.
  If the current was interrupted, the magnet immediately became unmagnetized. It was
  sufficient to place a plate of soft iron before the magnet, which, attracted during
  the passage of the current, would fall back when the current was interrupted. This
  movement of the plate thus obtained, Harding could easily fasten to it a needle
  arranged on a dial, bearing the letters of the alphabet, and in this way communicate
  from one station to the other.</p>
- <p>All was completely arranged by the 12th of February. On this day, Harding, having
  sent the current through the wire, asked if all was going on well at the corral,
  and received in a few moments a satisfactory reply from Ayrton. Pencroft was wild
  with joy, and every morning and evening he sent a telegram to the corral, which
  always received an answer.</p>
- '<p>This mode of communication presented two very real advantages: firstly, because
  it enabled them to ascertain that Ayrton was at the corral; and secondly, that he
  was thus not left completely isolated. Besides, Cyrus Harding never allowed a week
  to pass without going to see him, and Ayrton came from time to time to Granite House,
  where he always found a cordial welcome.</p>'
- <p>The fine season passed away in the midst of the usual work. The resources of
  the colony, particularly in vegetables and corn, increased from day to day, and
  the plants brought from Tabor Island had succeeded perfectly.</p>
- "<p>The plateau of Prospect Heights presented an encouraging aspect. The fourth\
  \ harvest had been admirable and it may be supposed that no one thought of counting\
  \ whether the four hundred thousand millions of grains duly appeared in the crop.\
  \ However, Pencroft had thought of doing so, but Cyrus Harding having told him that\
  \ even if he managed to count three hundred grains a minute, or nine thousand an\
  \ hour, it would take him nearly five thousand five\u2011hundred years to finish\
  \ his task, the honest sailor considered it best to give up the idea.</p>"
- "<p>The weather was splendid, the temperature very warm in the day time, but in\
  \ the evening the sea\u2011breezes tempered the heat of the atmosphere and procured\
  \ cool nights for the inhabitants of Granite House. There were, however, a few storms,\
  \ which, although they were not of long duration, swept over Lincoln Island with\
  \ extraordinary fury. The lightning blazed and the thunder continued to roll for\
  \ some hours.</p>"
- <p>At this period the little colony was extremely prosperous.</p>
- "<p>The tenants of the poultry\u2011yard swarmed, and they lived on the surplus,\
  \ but it became necessary to reduce the population to a more moderate number. The\
  \ pigs had already produced young, and it may be understood that their care for\
  \ these animals absorbed a great part of Neb and Pencroft\u2019s time. The onagers,\
  \ who had two pretty colts, were most often mounted by Gideon Spilett and Herbert,\
  \ who had become an excellent rider under the reporter\u2019s instruction, and they\
  \ also harnessed them to the cart either for carrying wood and coal to Granite House,\
  \ or different mineral productions required by the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>Several expeditions were made about this time into the depths of the Far West\
  \ Forests. The explorers could venture there without having anything to fear from\
  \ the heat, for the sun\u2019s rays scarcely penetrated through the thick foliage\
  \ spreading above their heads. They thus visited all the left bank of the Mercy,\
  \ along which ran the road from the corral to the mouth of Falls River.</p>"
- "<p>But in these excursions the settlers took care to be well armed, for they met\
  \ with savage wild boars, with which they often had a tussle. They also, during\
  \ this season, made fierce war against the jaguars. Gideon Spilett had vowed a special\
  \ hatred against them, and his pupil Herbert seconded him well. Armed as they were,\
  \ they no longer feared to meet one of those beasts. Herbert\u2019s courage was\
  \ superb, and the reporter\u2019s sang\u2011froid astonishing. Already twenty magnificent\
  \ skins ornamented the dining\u2011room of Granite House, and if this continued,\
  \ the jaguar race would soon be extinct in the island, the object aimed at by the\
  \ hunters.</p>"
- <p>The engineer sometimes took part in the expeditions made to the unknown parts
  of the island, which he surveyed with great attention. It was for other traces than
  those of animals that he searched the thickets of the vast forest, but nothing suspicious
  ever appeared. Neither Top nor Jup, who accompanied him, ever betrayed by their
  behavior that there was anything strange there, and yet more than once again the
  dog barked at the mouth of the well, which the engineer had before explored without
  result.</p>
- <p>At this time Gideon Spilett, aided by Herbert, took several views of the most
  picturesque parts of the island, by means of the photographic apparatus found in
  the cases, and of which they had not as yet made any use.</p>
- "<p>This apparatus, provided with a powerful object\u2011glass, was very complete.\
  \ Substances necessary for the photographic reproduction, collodion for preparing\
  \ the glass plate, nitrate of silver to render it sensitive, hyposulfate of soda\
  \ to fix the prints obtained, chloride of ammonium in which to soak the paper destined\
  \ to give the positive proof, acetate of soda and chloride of gold in which to immerse\
  \ the paper, nothing was wanting. Even the papers were there, all prepared, and\
  \ before laying in the printing\u2011frame upon the negatives, it was sufficient\
  \ to soak them for a few minutes in the solution of nitrate of silver.</p>"
- <p>The reporter and his assistant became in a short time very skilful operators,
  and they obtained fine views of the country, such as the island, taken from Prospect
  Heights with Mount Franklin in the distance, the mouth of the Mercy, so picturesquely
  framed in high rocks, the glade and the corral, with the spurs of the mountain in
  the background, the curious development of Claw Cape, Flotsam Point, etc.</p>
- <p>Nor did the photographers forget to take the portraits of all the inhabitants
  of the island, leaving out no one.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt multiplies us,\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>And the sailor was enchanted to see his own countenance, faithfully reproduced,\
  \ ornamenting the walls of Granite House, and he stopped as willingly before this\
  \ exhibition as he would have done before the richest shop\u2011windows in Broadway.</p>"
- <p>But it must be acknowledged that the most successful portrait was incontestably
  that of Master Jup. Master Jup had sat with a gravity not to be described, and his
  portrait was lifelike!</p>
- "<p>\u201CHe looks as if he was just going to grin!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>And if Master Jup had not been satisfied, he would have been very difficult to
  please; but he was quite contented and contemplated his own countenance with a sentimental
  air which expressed some small amount of conceit.</p>
- <p>The summer heat ended with the month of March. The weather was sometimes rainy,
  but still warm. The month of March, which corresponds to the September of northern
  latitudes, was not so fine as might have been hoped. Perhaps it announced an early
  and rigorous winter.</p>
- <p>It might have been supposed one morning?the 21 st?that the first snow had already
  made its appearance. In fact Herbert looking early from one of the windows of Granite
  House, exclaimed,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CHallo! the islet is covered with snow!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSnow at this time?\u201D answered the reporter, joining the boy.</p>"
- <p>Their companions were soon beside them, but could only ascertain one thing, that
  not only the islet but all the beach below Granite House was covered with one uniform
  sheet of white.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt must be snow!\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COr rather it\u2019s very like it!\u201D replied Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut the thermometer marks fifty\u2011eight degrees!\u201D observed Gideon\
  \ Spilett.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding gazed at the sheet of white without saying anything, for he really
  did not know how to explain this phenomenon, at this time of year and in such a
  temperature.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBy Jove!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201Call our plants will be frozen!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>And the sailor was about to descend, when he was preceded by the nimble Jup,
  who slid down to the sand.</p>
- <p>But the orang had not touched the ground, when the snowy sheet arose and dispersed
  in the air in such innumerable flakes that the light of the sun was obscured for
  some minutes.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBirds!\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>They were indeed swarms of sea\u2011birds, with dazzling white plumage. They\
  \ had perched by thousands on the islet and on the shore, and they disappeared in\
  \ the distance, leaving the colonists amazed as if they had been present at some\
  \ transformation scene, in which summer succeeded winter at the touch of a fairy\u2019\
  s wand. Unfortunately the change had been so sudden, that neither the reporter nor\
  \ the lad had been able to bring down one of these birds, of which they could not\
  \ recognize the species.</p>"
- <p>A few days after came the 26th of March, the day on which, two years before,
  the castaways from the air had been thrown upon Lincoln Island.</p>
- <p>Chapter 19</p>
- "<p>Two years already! and for two years the colonists had had no communication\
  \ with their fellow\u2011creatures! They were without news from the civilized world,\
  \ lost on this island, as completely as if they had been on the most minute star\
  \ of the celestial hemisphere!</p>"
- <p>What was now happening in their country? The picture of their native land was
  always before their eyes, the land torn by civil war at the time they left it, and
  which the Southern rebellion was perhaps still staining with blood! It was a great
  sorrow to them, and they often talked together of these things, without ever doubting
  however that the cause of the North must triumph, for the honor of the American
  Confederation.</p>
- <p>During these two years not a vessel had passed in sight of the island; or, at
  least, not a sail had been seen. It was evident that Lincoln Island was out of the
  usual track, and also that it was unknown,?as was besides proved by the maps,?for
  though there was no port, vessels might have visited it for the purpose of renewing
  their store of water. But the surrounding ocean was deserted as far as the eye could
  reach, and the colonists must rely on themselves for regaining their native land.</p>
- "<p>However, one chance of rescue existed, and this chance was discussed one day\
  \ on the first week of April, when the colonists were gathered together in the dining\u2011\
  room of Granite House.</p>"
- <p>They had been talking of America, of their native country, which they had so
  little hope of ever seeing again.</p>
- "<p>\u201CDecidedly we have only one way,\u201D said Spilett, \u201Cone single way\
  \ for leaving Lincoln Island, and that is, to build a vessel large enough to sail\
  \ several hundred miles. It appears to me, that when one has built a boat it is\
  \ just as easy to build a ship!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd in which we might go to the Pomoutous,\u201D added Herbert, \u201C\
  just as easily as we went to Tabor Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI do not say no,\u201D replied Pencroft, who had always the casting vote\
  \ in maritime questions; \u201CI do not say no, although it is not exactly the same\
  \ thing to make a long as a short voyage! If our little craft had been caught in\
  \ any heavy gale of wind during the voyage to Tabor Island, we should have known\
  \ that land was at no great distance either way; but twelve hundred miles is a pretty\
  \ long way, and the nearest land is at least that distance!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWould you not, in that case, Pencroft, attempt the adventure?\u201D asked\
  \ the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI will attempt anything that is desired, Mr. Spilett,\u201D answered the\
  \ sailor, \u201Cand you know well that I am not a man to flinch!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CRemember, besides, that we number another sailor amongst us now,\u201D\
  \ remarked Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho is that?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAyrton.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf he will consent to come,\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNonsense!\u201D returned the reporter; \u201Cdo you think that if Lord\
  \ Glenarvan\u2019s yacht had appeared at Tabor Island, while he was still living\
  \ there, Ayrton would have refused to depart?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou forget, my friends,\u201D then said Cyrus Harding, \u201Cthat Ayrton\
  \ was not in possession of his reason during the last years of his stay there. But\
  \ that is not the question. The point is to know if we may count among our chances\
  \ of being rescued, the return of the Scotch vessel. Now, Lord Glenarvan promised\
  \ Ayrton that he would return to take him off from Tabor Island when he considered\
  \ that his crimes were expiated, and I believe that he will return.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cand I will add that he will return\
  \ soon, for it is twelve years since Ayrton was abandoned.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell!\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201CI agree with you that the nobleman\
  \ will return, and soon too. But where will he touch? At Tabor Island, and not at\
  \ Lincoln Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is the more certain,\u201D replied Herbert, \u201Cas Lincoln Island\
  \ is not even marked on the map.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTherefore, my friends,\u201D said the engineer, \u201Cwe ought to take\
  \ the necessary precautions for making our presence and that of Ayrton on Lincoln\
  \ Island known at Tabor Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCertainly,\u201D answered the reporter, \u201Cand nothing is easier than\
  \ to place in the hut, which was Captain Grant\u2019s and Ayrton\u2019s dwelling,\
  \ a notice which Lord Glenarvan and his crew cannot help finding, giving the position\
  \ of our island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is a pity,\u201D remarked the sailor, \u201Cthat we forgot to take\
  \ that precaution on our first visit to Tabor Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd why should we have done it?\u201D asked Herbert. \u201CAt that time\
  \ we did not know Ayrton\u2019s history; we did not know that any one was likely\
  \ to come some day to fetch him, and when we did know his history, the season was\
  \ too advanced to allow us to return then to Tabor Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Harding, \u201Cit was too late, and we must put off\
  \ the voyage until next spring.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut suppose the Scotch yacht comes before that,\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is not probable,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cfor Lord Glenarvan\
  \ would not choose the winter season to venture into these seas. Either he has already\
  \ returned to Tabor Island, since Ayrton has been with us, that is to say, during\
  \ the last five months and has left again; or he will not come till later, and it\
  \ will be time enough in the first fine October days to go to Tabor Island, and\
  \ leave a notice there.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe must allow,\u201D said Neb, \u201Cthat it will be very unfortunate\
  \ if the ?Duncan\u2019 has returned to these parts only a few months ago!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CI hope that it is not so,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cand that\
  \ Heaven has not deprived us of the best chance which remains to us.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI think,\u201D observed the reporter, \u201Cthat at any rate we shall\
  \ know what we have to depend on when we have been to Tabor Island, for if the yacht\
  \ has returned there, they will necessarily have left some traces of their visit.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is evident,\u201D answered the engineer. \u201CSo then, my friends,\
  \ since we have this chance of returning to our country, we must wait patiently,\
  \ and if it is taken from us we shall see what will be best to do.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt any rate,\u201D remarked Pencroft, \u201Cit is well understood that\
  \ if we do leave Lincoln Island, it will not be because we were uncomfortable there!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Pencroft,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cit will be because we\
  \ are far from all that a man holds dearest in the world, his family, his friends,\
  \ his native land!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Matters being thus decided, the building of a vessel large enough to sail either
  to the Archipelagoes in the north, or to New Zealand in the west, was no longer
  talked of, and they busied themselves in their accustomed occupations, with a view
  to wintering a third time in Granite House.</p>
- "<p>However, it was agreed that before the stormy weather came on, their little\
  \ vessel should be employed in making a voyage round the island. A complete survey\
  \ of the coast had not yet been made, and the colonists had but an imperfect idea\
  \ of the shore to the west and north, from the mouth of Falls River to the Mandible\
  \ Capes, as well as of the narrow bay between them, which opened like a shark\u2019\
  s jaws.</p>"
- <p>The plan of this excursion was proposed by Pencroft, and Cyrus Harding fully
  acquiesced in it, for he himself wished to see this part of his domain.</p>
- "<p>The weather was variable, but the barometer did not fluctuate by sudden movements,\
  \ and they could therefore count on tolerable weather. However, during the first\
  \ week of April, after a sudden barometrical fall, a renewed rise was marked by\
  \ a heavy gale of wind, lasting five or six days; then the needle of the instrument\
  \ remained stationary at a height of twenty\u2011nine inches and nine\u2011tenths,\
  \ and the weather appeared propitious for an excursion.</p>"
- "<p>The departure was fixed for the 16th of April, and the \u201CBonadventure,\u201D\
  \ anchored in Port Balloon, was provisioned for a voyage which might be of some\
  \ duration.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding informed Ayrton of the projected expedition, and proposed that
  he should take part in it, but Ayrton preferring to remain on shore, it was decided
  that he should come to Granite House during the absence of his companions. Master
  Jup was ordered to keep him company, and made no remonstrance.</p>
- "<p>On the morning of the 16th of April all the colonists, including Top, embarked.\
  \ A fine breeze blew from the south\u2011west, and the \u201CBonadventure\u201D\
  \ tacked on leaving Port Balloon so as to reach Reptile End. Of the ninety miles\
  \ which the perimeter of the island measured, twenty included the south coast between\
  \ the port and the promontory. The wind being right ahead it was necessary to hug\
  \ the shore.</p>"
- <p>It took the whole day to reach the promontory, for the vessel on leaving port
  had only two hours of ebb tide and had therefore to make way for six hours against
  the flood. It was nightfall before the promontory was doubled.</p>
- "<p>The sailor then proposed to the engineer that they should continue sailing slowly\
  \ with two reefs in the sail. But Harding preferred to anchor a few cable\u2011\
  lengths from the shore, so as to survey that part of the coast during the day. It\
  \ was agreed also that as they were anxious for a minute exploration of the coast\
  \ they should not sail during the night, but would always, when the weather permitted\
  \ it, be at anchor near the shore.</p>"
- "<p>The night was passed under the promontory, and the wind having fallen, nothing\
  \ disturbed the silence. The passengers, with the exception of the sailor, scarcely\
  \ slept as well on board the \u201CBonadventure\u201D as they would have done in\
  \ their rooms at Granite House, but they did sleep however. Pencroft set sail at\
  \ break of day, and by going on the larboard tack they could keep close to the shore.</p>"
- <p>The colonists knew this beautiful wooded coast, since they had already explored
  it on foot, and yet it again excited their admiration. They coasted along as close
  in as possible, so as to notice everything, avoiding always the trunks of trees
  which floated here and there. Several times also they anchored, and Gideon Spilett
  took photographs of the superb scenery.</p>
- "<p>About noon the \u201CBonadventure\u201D arrived at the mouth of Falls River.\
  \ Beyond, on the left bank, a few scattered trees appeared, and three miles further\
  \ even these dwindled into solitary groups among the western spurs of the mountain,\
  \ whose arid ridge sloped down to the shore.</p>"
- <p>What a contrast between the northern and southern part of the coast! In proportion
  as one was woody and fertile so was the other rugged and barren! It might have been
  designated as one of those iron coasts, as they are called in some countries, and
  its wild confusion appeared to indicate that a sudden crystallization had been produced
  in the yet liquid basalt of some distant geological sea. These stupendous masses
  would have terrified the settlers if they had been cast at first on this part of
  the island! They had not been able to perceive the sinister aspect of this shore
  from the summit of Mount Franklin, for they overlooked it from too great a height,
  but viewed from the sea it presented a wild appearance which could not perhaps be
  equaled in any corner of the globe.</p>
- "<p>The \u201CBonadventure\u201D sailed along this coast for the distance of half\
  \ a mile. It was easy to see that it was composed of blocks of all sizes, from twenty\
  \ to three hundred feet in height, and of all shapes, round like towers, prismatic\
  \ like steeples, pyramidal like obelisks, conical like factory chimneys. An iceberg\
  \ of the Polar seas could not have been more capricious in its terrible sublimity!\
  \ Here, bridges were thrown from one rock to another; there, arches like those of\
  \ a wave, into the depths of which the eye could not penetrate; in one place, large\
  \ vaulted excavations presented a monumental aspect; in another, a crowd of columns,\
  \ spires, and arches, such as no Gothic cathedral ever possessed. Every caprice\
  \ of nature, still more varied than those of the imagination, appeared on this grand\
  \ coast, which extended over a length of eight or nine miles.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions gazed, with a feeling of surprise bordering
  on stupefaction. But, although they remained silent, Top, not being troubled with
  feelings of this sort, uttered barks which were repeated by the thousand echoes
  of the basaltic cliff. The engineer even observed that these barks had something
  strange in them, like those which the dog had uttered at the mouth of the well in
  Granite House.</p>
- "<p>\u201CLet us go close in,\u201D said he.</p>"
- "<p>And the \u201CBonadventure\u201D sailed as near as possible to the rocky shore.\
  \ Perhaps some cave, which it would be advisable to explore, existed there? But\
  \ Harding saw nothing, not a cavern, not a cleft which could serve as a retreat\
  \ to any being whatever, for the foot of the cliff was washed by the surf. Soon\
  \ Top\u2019s barks ceased, and the vessel continued her course at a few cables\u2011\
  length from the coast.</p>"
- "<p>In the northwest part of the island the shore became again flat and sandy. A\
  \ few trees here and there rose above a low, marshy ground, which the colonists\
  \ had already surveyed, and in violent contrast to the other desert shore, life\
  \ was again manifested by the presence of myriads of water\u2011fowl. That evening\
  \ the \u201CBonadventure\u201D anchored in a small bay to the north of the island,\
  \ near the land, such was the depth of water there. The night passed quietly, for\
  \ the breeze died away with the last light of day, and only rose again with the\
  \ first streaks of dawn.</p>"
- <p>As it was easy to land, the usual hunters of the colony, that is to say, Herbert
  and Gideon Spilett, went for a ramble of two hours or so, and returned with several
  strings of wild duck and snipe. Top had done wonders, and not a bird had been lost,
  thanks to his zeal and cleverness.</p>
- "<p>At eight o\u2019clock in the morning the \u201CBonadventure\u201D set sail,\
  \ and ran rapidly towards North Mandible Cape, for the wind was right astern and\
  \ freshening rapidly.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHowever,\u201D observed Pencroft, \u201CI should not be surprised if a\
  \ gale came up from the west. Yesterday the sun set in a very red\u2011looking horizon,\
  \ and now, this morning, those mares\u2011tails don\u2019t forbode anything good.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>These mares\u2011tails are cirrus clouds, scattered in the zenith, their height\
  \ from the sea being less than five thousand feet. They look like light pieces of\
  \ cotton wool, and their presence usually announces some sudden change in the weather.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D said Harding, \u201Clet us carry as much sail as possible,\
  \ and run for shelter into Shark Gulf. I think that the ?Bonadventure\u2019 will\
  \ be safe there.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerfectly,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cand besides, the north coast\
  \ is merely sand, very uninteresting to look at.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI shall not be sorry,\u201D resumed the engineer, \u201Cto pass not only\
  \ to\u2011night but to\u2011morrow in that bay, which is worth being carefully explored.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CI think that we shall be obliged to do so, whether we like it or not,\u201D\
  \ answered Pencroft, \u201Cfor the sky looks very threatening towards the west.\
  \ Dirty weather is coming on!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt any rate we have a favorable wind for reaching Cape Mandible,\u201D\
  \ observed the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA very fine wind,\u201D replied the sailor; \u201Cbut we must tack to\
  \ enter the gulf, and I should like to see my way clear in these unknown quarters.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CQuarters which appear to be filled with rocks,\u201D added Herbert, \u201C\
  if we judge by what we saw on the south coast of Shark Gulf.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPencroft,\u201D said Cyrus Harding, \u201Cdo as you think best, we will\
  \ leave it to you.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDon\u2019t make your mind uneasy, captain,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201C\
  I shall not expose myself needlessly! I would rather a knife were run into my ribs\
  \ than a sharp rock into those of my ?Bonadventure!\u201C</p>"
- <p>That which Pencroft called ribs was the part of his vessel under water, and he
  valued it more than his own skin.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat o\u2019clock is it?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTen o\u2019clock,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd what distance is it to the Cape, captain?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAbout fifteen miles,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat\u2019s a matter of two hours and a half,\u201D said the sailor, \u201C\
  and we shall be off the Cape between twelve and one o\u2019clock. Unluckily, the\
  \ tide will be turning at that moment, and will be ebbing out of the gulf. I am\
  \ afraid that it will be very difficult to get in, having both wind and tide against\
  \ us.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd the more so that it is a full moon to\u2011day,\u201D remarked Herbert,\
  \ \u201Cand these April tides are very strong.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, Pencroft,\u201D asked Harding, \u201Ccan you not anchor off the\
  \ Cape?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnchor near land, with bad weather coming on!\u201D exclaimed the sailor.\
  \ \u201CWhat are you thinking of, captain? We should run aground, of a certainty!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat will you do then?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI shall try to keep in the offing until the flood, that is to say, till\
  \ about seven in the evening, and if there is still light enough I will try to enter\
  \ the gulf; if not, we must stand off and on during the night, and we will enter\
  \ to\u2011morrow at sunrise.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAs I told you, Pencroft, we will leave it to you,\u201D answered Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh!\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cif there was only a lighthouse on the coast,\
  \ it would be much more convenient for sailors.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Herbert, \u201Cand this time we shall have no obliging\
  \ engineer to light a fire to guide us into port!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy, indeed, my dear Cyrus,\u201D said Spilett, \u201Cwe have never thanked\
  \ you; but frankly, without that fire we should never have been able?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA fire?\u201D asked Harding, much astonished at the reporter\u2019s words.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe mean, captain,\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201Cthat on board the ?Bonadventure\u2019\
  \ we were very anxious during the few hours before our return, and we should have\
  \ passed to windward of the island, if it had not been for the precaution you took\
  \ of lighting a fire the night of the 19th of October, on Prospect Heights.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, yes! That was a lucky idea of mine!\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd this time,\u201D continued the sailor, \u201Cunless the idea occurs\
  \ to Ayrton, there will be no one to do us that little service!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo! No one!\u201D answered Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- <p>A few minutes after, finding himself alone in the bows of the vessel, with the
  reporter, the engineer bent down and whispered,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CIf there is one thing certain in this world, Spilett, it is that I never\
  \ lighted any fire during the night of the 19th of October, neither on Prospect\
  \ Heights nor on any other part of the island!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 20</p>
- "<p>Things happened as Pencroft had predicted, he being seldom mistaken in his prognostications.\
  \ The wind rose, and from a fresh breeze it soon increased to a regular gale; that\
  \ is to say, it acquired a speed of from forty to forty\u2011five miles an hour,\
  \ before which a ship in the open sea would have run under close\u2011reefed topsails.\
  \ Now, as it was nearly six o\u2019clock when the \u201CBonadventure\u201D reached\
  \ the gulf, and as at that moment the tide turned, it was impossible to enter. They\
  \ were therefore compelled to stand off, for even if he had wished to do so, Pencroft\
  \ could not have gained the mouth of the Mercy. Hoisting the jib to the mainmast\
  \ by way of a storm\u2011sail, he hove to, putting the head of the vessel towards\
  \ the land.</p>"
- "<p>Fortunately, although the wind was strong the sea, being sheltered by the land,\
  \ did not run very high. They had then little to fear from the waves, which always\
  \ endanger small craft. The \u201CBonadventure\u201D would doubtlessly not have\
  \ capsized, for she was well ballasted, but enormous masses of water falling on\
  \ the deck might injure her if her timbers could not sustain them. Pencroft, as\
  \ a good sailor, was prepared for anything. Certainly, he had great confidence in\
  \ his vessel, but nevertheless he awaited the return of day with some anxiety.</p>"
- "<p>During the night, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett had no opportunity for talking\
  \ together, and yet the words pronounced in the reporter\u2019s ear by the engineer\
  \ were well worth being discussed, together with the mysterious influence which\
  \ appeared to reign over Lincoln Island. Gideon Spilett did not cease from pondering\
  \ over this new and inexplicable incident, the appearance of a fire on the coast\
  \ of the island. The fire had actually been seen! His companions, Herbert and Pencroft,\
  \ had seen it with him! The fire had served to signalize the position of the island\
  \ during that dark night, and they had not doubted that it was lighted by the engineer\u2019\
  s hand; and here was Cyrus Harding expressly declaring that he had never done anything\
  \ of the sort! Spilett resolved to recur to this incident as soon as the \u201C\
  Bonadventure\u201D returned, and to urge Cyrus Harding to acquaint their companions\
  \ with these strange facts. Perhaps it would be decided to make in common a complete\
  \ investigation of every part of Lincoln Island.</p>"
- <p>However that might be, on this evening no fire was lighted on these yet unknown
  shores, which formed the entrance to the gulf, and the little vessel stood off during
  the night.</p>
- "<p>When the first streaks of dawn appeared in the western horizon, the wind, which\
  \ had slightly fallen, shifted two points, and enabled Pencroft to enter the narrow\
  \ gulf with greater ease. Towards seven o\u2019clock in the morning, the \u201C\
  Bonadventure,\u201D weathering the North Mandible Cape, entered the strait and glided\
  \ on to the waters, so strangely enclosed in the frame of lava.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cthis bay would make admirable roads,\
  \ in which a whole fleet could lie at their ease!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is especially curious,\u201D observed Harding, \u201Cis that the\
  \ gulf has been formed by two rivers of lava, thrown out by the volcano, and accumulated\
  \ by successive eruptions. The result is that the gulf is completely sheltered on\
  \ all sides, and I believe that even in the stormiest weather, the sea here must\
  \ be as calm as a lake.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo doubt,\u201D returned the sailor, \u201Csince the wind has only that\
  \ narrow entrance between the two capes to get in by, and, besides, the north cape\
  \ protects that of the south in a way which would make the entrance of gusts very\
  \ difficult. I declare our ?Bonadventure\u2019 could stay here from one end of the\
  \ year to the other, without even dragging at her anchor!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is rather large for her!\u201D observed the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell! Mr. Spilett,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201CI agree that it is\
  \ too large for the ?Bonadventure,\u2019 but if the fleets of the Union were in\
  \ want of a harbor in the Pacific, I don\u2019t think they would ever find a better\
  \ place than this!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe are in the shark\u2019s mouth,\u201D remarked Neb, alluding to the\
  \ form of the gulf.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CRight into its mouth, my honest Neb!\u201D replied Herbert, \u201Cbut\
  \ you are not afraid that it will shut upon us, are you?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Mr. Herbert,\u201D answered Neb, \u201Cand yet this gulf here doesn\u2019\
  t please me much! It has a wicked look!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHallo!\u201D cried Pencroft, \u201Chere is Neb turning up his nose at\
  \ my gulf, just as I was thinking of presenting it to America!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, at any rate, is the water deep enough?\u201D asked the engineer,\
  \ \u201Cfor a depth sufficient for the keel of the ?Bonadventure\u2019 would not\
  \ be enough for those of our iron\u2011clads.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is easily found out,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>And the sailor sounded with a long cord, which served him as a lead\u2011line,\
  \ and to which was fastened a lump of iron. This cord measured nearly fifty fathoms,\
  \ and its entire length was unrolled without finding any bottom.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere,\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201Cour iron\u2011clads can come here\
  \ after all! They would not run aground!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIndeed,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cthis gulf is a regular abyss,\
  \ but, taking into consideration the volcanic origin of the island, it is not astonishing\
  \ that the sea should offer similar depressions.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COne would say too,\u201D observed Herbert, \u201Cthat these cliffs were\
  \ perfectly perpendicular; and I believe that at their foot, even with a line five\
  \ or six times longer, Pencroft would not find bottom.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is all very well,\u201D then said the reporter, \u201Cbut I must\
  \ point out to Pencroft that his harbor is wanting in one very important respect!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd what is that, Mr. Spilett?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAn opening, a cutting of some sort, to give access to the interior of\
  \ the island. I do not see a spot on which we could land.\u201D And, in fact, the\
  \ steep lava cliffs did not afford a single place suitable for landing. They formed\
  \ an insuperable barrier, recalling, but with more wildness, the fiords of Norway.\
  \ The \u201CBonadventure,\u201D coasting as close as possible along the cliffs,\
  \ did not discover even a projection which would allow the passengers to leave the\
  \ deck.</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft consoled himself by saying that with the help of a mine they could\
  \ soon open out the cliff when that was necessary, and then, as there was evidently\
  \ nothing to be done in the gulf, he steered his vessel towards the strait and passed\
  \ out at about two o\u2019clock in the afternoon.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh!\u201D said Neb, uttering a sigh of satisfaction.</p>"
- <p>One might really say that the honest Negro did not feel at his ease in those
  enormous jaws.</p>
- "<p>The distance from Mandible Cape to the mouth of the Mercy was not more than\
  \ eight miles. The head of the \u201CBonadventure\u201D was put towards Granite\
  \ House, and a fair wind filling her sails, she ran rapidly along the coast.</p>"
- <p>To the enormous lava rocks succeeded soon those capricious sand dunes, among
  which the engineer had been so singularly recovered, and which seabirds frequented
  in thousands.</p>
- "<p>About four o\u2019clock, Pencroft leaving the point of the islet on his left,\
  \ entered the channel which separated it from the coast, and at five o\u2019clock\
  \ the anchor of the \u201CBonadventure\u201D was buried in the sand at the mouth\
  \ of the Mercy.</p>"
- <p>The colonists had been absent three days from their dwelling. Ayrton was waiting
  for them on the beach, and Jup came joyously to meet them, giving vent to deep grunts
  of satisfaction.</p>
- <p>A complete exploration of the coast of the island had now been made, and no suspicious
  appearances had been observed. If any mysterious being resided on it, it could only
  be under cover of the impenetrable forest of the Serpentine Peninsula, to which
  the colonists had not yet directed their investigations.</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett discussed these things with the engineer, and it was agreed that
  they should direct the attention of their companions to the strange character of
  certain incidents which had occurred on the island, and of which the last was the
  most unaccountable.</p>
- <p>However, Harding, returning to the fact of a fire having been kindled on the
  shore by an unknown hand, could not refrain from repeating for the twentieth time
  to the reporter,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut are you quite sure of having seen it? Was it not a partial eruption\
  \ of the volcano, or perhaps some meteor?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Cyrus,\u201D answered the reporter, \u201Cit was certainly a fire\
  \ lighted by the hand of man. Besides; question Pencroft and Herbert. They saw it\
  \ as I saw it myself, and they will confirm my words.\u201D</p>"
- <p>In consequence, therefore, a few days after, on the 25th of April, in the evening,
  when the settlers were all collected on Prospect Heights, Cyrus Harding began by
  saying,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friends, I think it my duty to call your attention to certain incidents\
  \ which have occurred in the island, on the subject of which I shall be happy to\
  \ have your advice. These incidents are, so to speak, supernatural?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSupernatural!\u201D exclaimed the sailor, emitting a volume of smoke from\
  \ his mouth. \u201CCan it be possible that our island is supernatural?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Pencroft, but mysterious, most certainly,\u201D replied the engineer;\
  \ \u201Cunless you can explain that which Spilett and I have until now failed to\
  \ understand.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSpeak away, captain,\u201D answered the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, have you understood,\u201D then said the engineer, \u201Chow was\
  \ it that after falling into the sea, I was found a quarter of a mile into the interior\
  \ of the island, and that, without my having any consciousness of my removal there?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CUnless, being unconscious?\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is not admissible,\u201D replied the engineer. \u201CBut to continue.\
  \ Have you understood how Top was able to discover your retreat five miles from\
  \ the cave in which I was lying?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe dog\u2019s instinct?\u201D observed Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSingular instinct!\u201D returned the reporter, \u201Csince notwithstanding\
  \ the storm of rain and wind which was raging during that night, Top arrived at\
  \ the Chimneys, dry and without a speck of mud!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us continue,\u201D resumed the engineer. \u201CHave you understood\
  \ how our dog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his\
  \ struggle with the dugong?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo! I confess, not at all,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cand the wound\
  \ which the dugong had in its side, a wound which seemed to have been made with\
  \ a sharp instrument; that can\u2019t be understood, either.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us continue again,\u201D said Harding. \u201CHave you understood,\
  \ my friends, how that bullet got into the body of the young peccary; how that case\
  \ happened to be so fortunately stranded, without there being any trace of a wreck;\
  \ how that bottle containing the document presented itself so opportunely, during\
  \ our first sea\u2011excursion; how our canoe, having broken its moorings, floated\
  \ down the current of the Mercy and rejoined us at the very moment we needed it;\
  \ how after the ape invasion the ladder was so obligingly thrown down from Granite\
  \ House; and lastly, how the document, which Ayrton asserts was never written by\
  \ him, fell into our hands?\u201D</p>"
- <p>As Cyrus Harding thus enumerated, without forgetting one, the singular incidents
  which had occurred in the island, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft stared at each other,
  not knowing what to reply, for this succession of incidents, grouped thus for the
  first time, could not but excite their surprise to the highest degree.</p>
- "<p>\u201C?Pon my word,\u201D said Pencroft at last, \u201Cyou are right, captain,\
  \ and it is difficult to explain all these things!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, my friends,\u201D resumed the engineer, \u201Ca last fact has just\
  \ been added to these, and it is no less incomprehensible than the others!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is it, captain?\u201D asked Herbert quickly.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhen you were returning from Tabor Island, Pencroft,\u201D continued the\
  \ engineer, \u201Cyou said that a fire appeared on Lincoln Island?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCertainly,\u201D answered the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd you are quite certain of having seen this fire?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAs sure as I see you now.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou also, Herbert?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy, captain,\u201D cried Herbert, \u201Cthat fire was blazing like a\
  \ star of the first magnitude!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut was it not a star?\u201D urged the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cfor the sky was covered with thick clouds,\
  \ and at any rate a star would not have been so low on the horizon. But Mr. Spilett\
  \ saw it as well as we, and he will confirm our words.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI will add,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cthat the fire was very bright,\
  \ and that it shot up like a sheet of lightning.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, yes! exactly,\u201D added Herbert, \u201Cand it was certainly placed\
  \ on the heights of Granite House.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, my friends,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cduring the night\
  \ of the 19th of October, neither Neb nor I lighted any fire on the coast.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou did not!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, in the height of his astonishment,\
  \ not being able to finish his sentence.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe did not leave Granite House,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding, \u201Cand\
  \ if a fire appeared on the coast, it was lighted by another hand than ours!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb were stupefied. No illusion could be possible, and
  a fire had actually met their eyes during the night of the 19th of October. Yes!
  they had to acknowledge it, a mystery existed! An inexplicable influence, evidently
  favorable to the colonists, but very irritating to their curiosity, was executed
  always in the nick of time on Lincoln Island. Could there be some being hidden in
  its profoundest recesses? It was necessary at any cost to ascertain this.</p>
- <p>Harding also reminded his companions of the singular behavior of Top and Jup
  when they prowled round the mouth of the well, which placed Granite House in communication
  with the sea, and he told them that he had explored the well, without discovering
  anything suspicious. The final resolve taken, in consequence of this conversation,
  by all the members of the colony, was that as soon as the fine season returned they
  would thoroughly search the whole of the island.</p>
- <p>But from that day Pencroft appeared to be anxious. He felt as if the island which
  he had made his own personal property belonged to him entirely no longer, and that
  he shared it with another master, to whom, willing or not, he felt subject. Neb
  and he often talked of those unaccountable things, and both, their natures inclining
  them to the marvelous, were not far from believing that Lincoln Island was under
  the dominion of some supernatural power.</p>
- <p>In the meanwhile, the bad weather came with the month of May, the November of
  the northern zones. It appeared that the winter would be severe and forward. The
  preparations for the winter season were therefore commenced without delay.</p>
- <p>Nevertheless, the colonists were well prepared to meet the winter, however hard
  it might be. They had plenty of felt clothing, and the musmons, very numerous by
  this time, had furnished an abundance of wool necessary for the manufacture of this
  warm material.</p>
- <p>It is unnecessary to say that Ayrton had been provided with this comfortable
  clothing. Cyrus Harding proposed that he should come to spend the bad season with
  them in Granite House, where he would be better lodged than at the corral, and Ayrton
  promised to do so, as soon as the last work at the corral was finished. He did this
  towards the middle of April. From that time Ayrton shared the common life, and made
  himself useful on all occasions; but still humble and sad, he never took part in
  the pleasures of his companions.</p>
- <p>For the greater part of this, the third winter which the settlers passed in Lincoln
  Island, they were confined to Granite House. There were many violent storms and
  frightful tempests, which appeared to shake the rocks to their very foundations.
  Immense waves threatened to overwhelm the island, and certainly any vessel anchored
  near the shore would have been dashed to pieces. Twice, during one of these hurricanes,
  the Mercy swelled to such a degree as to give reason to fear that the bridges would
  be swept away, and it was necessary to strengthen those on the shore, which disappeared
  under the foaming waters, when the sea beat against the beach.</p>
- "<p>It may well be supposed that such storms, comparable to water\u2011spouts in\
  \ which were mingled rain and snow, would cause great havoc on the plateau of Prospect\
  \ Heights. The mill and the poultry\u2011yard particularly suffered. The colonists\
  \ were often obliged to make immediate repairs, without which the safety of the\
  \ birds would have been seriously threatened.</p>"
- "<p>During the worst weather, several jaguars and troops of quadrumana ventured\
  \ to the edge of the plateau, and it was always to be feared that the most active\
  \ and audacious would, urged by hunger, manage to cross the stream, which besides,\
  \ when frozen, offered them an easy passage. Plantations and domestic animals would\
  \ then have been infallibly destroyed, without a constant watch, and it was often\
  \ necessary to make use of the guns to keep those dangerous visitors at a respectful\
  \ distance. Occupation was not wanting to the colonists, for without reckoning their\
  \ out\u2011door cares, they had always a thousand plans for the fitting up of Granite\
  \ House.</p>"
- "<p>They had also some fine sporting excursions, which were made during the frost\
  \ in the vast Tadorn Marsh. Gideon Spilett and Herbert, aided by Jup and Top, did\
  \ not miss a shot in the midst of myriads of wild\u2011duck, snipe, teal, and others.\
  \ The access to these hunting\u2011grounds was easy; besides, whether they reached\
  \ them by the road to Port Balloon, after having passed the Mercy Bridge, or by\
  \ turning the rocks from Flotsam Point, the hunters were never distant from Granite\
  \ House more than two or three miles.</p>"
- <p>Thus passed the four winter months, which were really rigorous, that is to say,
  June, July, August, and September. But, in short, Granite House did not suffer much
  from the inclemency of the weather, and it was the same with the corral, which,
  less exposed than the plateau, and sheltered partly by Mount Franklin, only received
  the remains of the hurricanes, already broken by the forests and the high rocks
  of the shore. The damages there were consequently of small importance, and the activity
  and skill of Ayrton promptly repaired them, when some time in October he returned
  to pass a few days in the corral.</p>
- <p>During this winter, no fresh inexplicable incident occurred. Nothing strange
  happened, although Pencroft and Neb were on the watch for the most insignificant
  facts to which they attached any mysterious cause. Top and Jup themselves no longer
  growled round the well or gave any signs of uneasiness. It appeared, therefore,
  as if the series of supernatural incidents was interrupted, although they often
  talked of them during the evenings in Granite House, and they remained thoroughly
  resolved that the island should be searched, even in those parts the most difficult
  to explore. But an event of the highest importance, and of which the consequences
  might be terrible, momentarily diverted from their projects Cyrus Harding and his
  companions.</p>
- <p>It was the month of October. The fine season was swiftly returning. Nature was
  reviving; and among the evergreen foliage of the coniferae which formed the border
  of the wood, already appeared the young leaves of the banksias, deodars, and other
  trees.</p>
- <p>It may be remembered that Gideon Spilett and Herbert had, at different times,
  taken photographic views of Lincoln Island.</p>
- "<p>Now, on the 17th of this month of October, towards three o\u2019clock in the\
  \ afternoon, Herbert, enticed by the charms of the sky, thought of reproducing Union\
  \ Bay, which was opposite to Prospect Heights, from Cape Mandible to Claw Cape.</p>"
- "<p>The horizon was beautifully clear, and the sea, undulating under a soft breeze,\
  \ was as calm as the waters of a lake, sparkling here and there under the sun\u2019\
  s rays.</p>"
- "<p>The apparatus had been placed at one of the windows of the dining\u2011room\
  \ at Granite House, and consequently overlooked the shore and the bay. Herbert proceeded\
  \ as he was accustomed to do, and the negative obtained, he went away to fix it\
  \ by means of the chemicals deposited in a dark nook of Granite House.</p>"
- <p>Returning to the bright light, and examining it well, Herbert perceived on his
  negative an almost imperceptible little spot on the sea horizon. He endeavored to
  make it disappear by reiterated washing, but could not accomplish it.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is a flaw in the glass,\u201D he thought.</p>"
- <p>And then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong magnifier which
  he unscrewed from one of the telescopes.</p>
- <p>But he had scarcely looked at it, when he uttered a cry, and the glass almost
  fell from his hands.</p>
- <p>Immediately running to the room in which Cyrus Harding then was, he extended
  the negative and magnifier towards the engineer, pointing out the little spot.</p>
- <p>Harding examined it; then seizing his telescope he rushed to the window.</p>
- "<p>The telescope, after having slowly swept the horizon, at last stopped on the\
  \ looked\u2011for spot, and Cyrus Harding, lowering it, pronounced one word only,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA vessel!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And in fact a vessel was in sight, off Lincoln Island!</p>
- <p>PART 3. THE SECRET OF THE ISLAND</p>
- <p>Chapter 1</p>
- "<p>It was now two years and a half since the castaways from the balloon had been\
  \ thrown on Lincoln Island, and during that period there had been no communication\
  \ between them and their fellow\u2011creatures. Once the reporter had attempted\
  \ to communicate with the inhabited world by confiding to a bird a letter which\
  \ contained the secret of their situation, but that was a chance on which it was\
  \ impossible to reckon seriously. Ayrton, alone, under the circumstances which have\
  \ been related, had come to join the little colony. Now, suddenly, on this day,\
  \ the 17th of October, other men had unexpectedly appeared in sight of the island,\
  \ on that deserted sea!</p>"
- <p>There could be no doubt about it! A vessel was there! But would she pass on,
  or would she put into port? In a few hours the colonists would definitely know what
  to expect.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding and Herbert having immediately called Gideon Spilett, Pencroft,\
  \ and Neb into the dining\u2011room of Granite House, told them what had happened.\
  \ Pencroft, seizing the telescope, rapidly swept the horizon, and stopping on the\
  \ indicated point, that is to say, on that which had made the almost imperceptible\
  \ spot on the photographic negative,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI\u2019m blessed but it is really a vessel!\u201D he exclaimed, in a voice\
  \ which did not express any great amount of satisfaction.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIs she coming here?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CImpossible to say anything yet,\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201Cfor her\
  \ rigging alone is above the horizon, and not a bit of her hull can be seen.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is to be done?\u201D asked the lad.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWait,\u201D replied Harding.</p>"
- "<p>And for a considerable time the settlers remained silent, given up to all the\
  \ thoughts, and the emotions, all the fears, all the hopes, which were aroused by\
  \ this incident?the most important which had occurred since their arrival in Lincoln\
  \ Island. Certainly, the colonists were not in the situation of castaways abandoned\
  \ on a sterile islet, constantly contending against a cruel nature for their miserable\
  \ existence, and incessantly tormented by the longing to return to inhabited countries.\
  \ Pencroft and Neb, especially, who felt themselves at once so happy and so rich,\
  \ would not have left their island without regret. They were accustomed, besides,\
  \ to this new life in the midst of the domain which their intelligence had as it\
  \ were civilized. But at any rate this ship brought news from the world, perhaps\
  \ even from their native land. It was bringing fellow\u2011creatures to them, and\
  \ it may be conceived how deeply their hearts were moved at the sight!</p>"
- "<p>From time to time Pencroft took the glass and rested himself at the window.\
  \ From thence he very attentively examined the vessel, which was at a distance of\
  \ twenty miles to the east. The colonists had as yet, therefore, no means of signalizing\
  \ their presence. A flag would not have been perceived; a gun would not have been\
  \ heard; a fire would not have been visible. However, it was certain that the island,\
  \ overtopped by Mount Franklin, could not escape the notice of the vessel\u2019\
  s lookout. But why was the ship coming there? Was it simple chance which brought\
  \ it to that part of the Pacific, where the maps mentioned no land except Tabor\
  \ Island, which itself was out of the route usually followed by vessels from the\
  \ Polynesian Archipelagoes, from New Zealand, and from the American coast? To this\
  \ question, which each one asked himself, a reply was suddenly made by Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCan it be the ?Duncan\u2019?\u201D he cried.</p>"
- "<p>The \u201CDuncan,\u201D as has been said, was Lord Glenarvan\u2019s yacht, which\
  \ had left Ayrton on the islet, and which was to return there someday to fetch him.\
  \ Now, the islet was not so far distant from Lincoln Island, but that a vessel,\
  \ standing for the one, could pass in sight of the other. A hundred and fifty miles\
  \ only separated them in longitude, and seventy in latitude.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe must tell Ayrton,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cand send for him\
  \ immediately. He alone can say if it is the ?Duncan.\u201C</p>"
- "<p>This was the opinion of all, and the reporter, going to the telegraphic apparatus\
  \ which placed the corral in communication with Granite House, sent this telegram:?\u201C\
  Come with all possible speed.\u201D</p>"
- <p>In a few minutes the bell sounded.</p>
- "<p>\u201CI am coming,\u201D replied Ayrton.</p>"
- <p>Then the settlers continued to watch the vessel.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIf it is the ?Duncan,\u201C said Herbert, \u201CAyrton will recognize\
  \ her without difficulty, since he sailed on board her for some time.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd if he recognizes her,\u201D added Pencroft, \u201Cit will agitate\
  \ him exceedingly!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding; \u201Cbut now Ayrton is worthy to return\
  \ on board the ?Duncan,\u2019 and pray Heaven that it is indeed Lord Glenarvan\u2019\
  s yacht, for I should be suspicious of any other vessel. These are ill\u2011famed\
  \ seas, and I have always feared a visit from Malay pirates to our island.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe could defend it,\u2019, cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo doubt, my boy,\u201D answered the engineer smiling, \u201Cbut it would\
  \ be better not to have to defend it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA useless observation,\u201D said Spilett. \u201CLincoln Island is unknown\
  \ to navigators, since it is not marked even on the most recent maps. Do you think,\
  \ Cyrus, that that is a sufficient motive for a ship, finding herself unexpectedly\
  \ in sight of new land, to try and visit rather than avoid it?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCertainly,\u201D replied Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI think so too,\u201D added the engineer. \u201CIt may even be said that\
  \ it is the duty of a captain to come and survey any land or island not yet known,\
  \ and Lincoln Island is in this position.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Csuppose this vessel comes and anchors\
  \ there a few cables\u2011lengths from our island, what shall we do?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>This sudden question remained at first without any reply. But Cyrus Harding,\
  \ after some moments\u2019 thought, replied in the calm tone which was usual to\
  \ him,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat we shall do, my friends? What we ought to do is this:?we will communicate\
  \ with the ship, we will take our passage on board her, and we will leave our island,\
  \ after having taken possession of it in the name of the United States. Then we\
  \ will return with any who may wish to follow us to colonize it definitely, and\
  \ endow the American Republic with a useful station in this part of the Pacific\
  \ Ocean!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHurrah!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201Cand that will be no small present\
  \ which we shall make to our country! The colonization is already almost finished;\
  \ names are given to every part of the island; there is a natural port, fresh water,\
  \ roads, a telegraph, a dockyard, and manufactories; and there will be nothing to\
  \ be done but to inscribe Lincoln Island on the maps!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut if anyone seizes it in our absence?\u201D observed Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHang it!\u201D cried the sailor. \u201CI would rather remain all alone\
  \ to guard it: and trust to Pencroft, they shouldn\u2019t steal it from him, like\
  \ a watch from the pocket of a swell!\u201D</p>"
- <p>For an hour it was impossible to say with any certainty whether the vessel was
  or was not standing towards Lincoln Island. She was nearer, but in what direction
  was she sailing? This Pencroft could not determine. However, as the wind was blowing
  from the northeast, in all probability the vessel was sailing on the starboard tack.
  Besides, the wind was favorable for bringing her towards the island, and, the sea
  being calm, she would not be afraid to approach although the shallows were not marked
  on the chart.</p>
- "<p>Towards four o\u2019clock?an hour after he had been sent for?Ayrton arrived\
  \ at Granite House. He entered the dining\u2011room saying,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt your service, gentlemen.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding gave him his hand, as was his custom to do, and, leading him to
  the window,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CAyrton,\u201D said he, \u201Cwe have begged you to come here for an important\
  \ reason. A ship is in sight of the island.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Ayrton at first paled slightly, and for a moment his eyes became dim; then, leaning
  out the window, he surveyed the horizon, but could see nothing.</p>
- "<p>\u201CTake this telescope,\u201D said Spilett, \u201Cand look carefully, Ayrton,\
  \ for it is possible that this ship may be the ?Duncan\u2019 come to these seas\
  \ for the purpose of taking you home again.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe ?Duncan!\u201C murmured Ayrton. \u201CAlready?\u201D This last word\
  \ escaped Ayrton\u2019s lips as if involuntarily, and his head drooped upon his\
  \ hands.</p>"
- "<p>Did not twelve years\u2019 solitude on a desert island appear to him a sufficient\
  \ expiation? Did not the penitent yet feel himself pardoned, either in his own eyes\
  \ or in the eyes of others?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D said he, \u201Cno! it cannot be the ?Duncan\u2019!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLook, Ayrton,\u201D then said the engineer, \u201Cfor it is necessary\
  \ that we should know beforehand what to expect.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Ayrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated. During some
  minutes he examined the horizon without moving, without uttering a word. Then,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is indeed a vessel,\u201D said he, \u201Cbut I do not think she is\
  \ the ?Duncan.\u201C</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy do you not think so?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBecause the ?Duncan\u2019 is a steam\u2011yacht, and I cannot perceive\
  \ any trace of smoke either above or near that vessel.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps she is simply sailing,\u201D observed Pencroft. \u201CThe wind\
  \ is favorable for the direction which she appears to be taking, and she may be\
  \ anxious to economize her coal, being so far from land.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is possible that you may be right, Mr. Pencroft,\u201D answered Ayrton,\
  \ \u201Cand that the vessel has extinguished her fires. We must wait until she is\
  \ nearer, and then we shall soon know what to expect.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>So saying, Ayrton sat down in a corner of the room and remained silent. The\
  \ colonists again discussed the strange ship, but Ayrton took no part in the conversation.\
  \ All were in such a mood that they found it impossible to continue their work.\
  \ Gideon Spilett and Pencroft were particularly nervous, going, coming, not able\
  \ to remain still in one place. Herbert felt more curiosity. Neb alone maintained\
  \ his usual calm manner. Was not his country that where his master was? As to the\
  \ engineer, he remained plunged in deep thought, and in his heart feared rather\
  \ than desired the arrival of the ship. In the meanwhile, the vessel was a little\
  \ nearer the island. With the aid of the glass, it was ascertained that she was\
  \ a brig, and not one of those Malay proas, which are generally used by the pirates\
  \ of the Pacific. It was, therefore, reasonable to believe that the engineer\u2019\
  s apprehensions would not be justified, and that the presence of this vessel in\
  \ the vicinity of the island was fraught with no danger.</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft, after a minute examination, was able positively to affirm that the\
  \ vessel was rigged as a brig, and that she was standing obliquely towards the coast,\
  \ on the starboard tack, under her topsails and top\u2011gallant\u2011sails. This\
  \ was confirmed by Ayrton. But by continuing in this direction she must soon disappear\
  \ behind Claw Cape, as the wind was from the southwest, and to watch her it would\
  \ be then necessary to ascend the height of Washington Bay, near Port Balloon?a\
  \ provoking circumstance, for it was already five o\u2019clock in the evening, and\
  \ the twilight would soon make any observation extremely difficult.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat shall we do when night comes on?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett. \u201C\
  Shall we light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?\u201D</p>"
- <p>This was a serious question, and yet, although the engineer still retained some
  of his presentiments, it was answered in the affirmative. During the night the ship
  might disappear and leave for ever, and, this ship gone, would another ever return
  to the waters of Lincoln Island? Who could foresee what the future would then have
  in store for the colonists?</p>
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cwe ought to make known to that vessel,\
  \ whoever she may be, that the island is inhabited. To neglect the opportunity which\
  \ is offered to us might be to create everlasting regrets.\u201D</p>"
- <p>It was therefore decided that Neb and Pencroft should go to Port Balloon, and
  that there, at nightfall, they should light an immense fire, the blaze of which
  would necessarily attract the attention of the brig.</p>
- "<p>But at the moment when Neb and the sailor were preparing to leave Granite House,\
  \ the vessel suddenly altered her course, and stood directly for Union Bay. The\
  \ brig was a good sailer, for she approached rapidly. Neb and Pencroft put off their\
  \ departure, therefore, and the glass was put into Ayrton\u2019s hands, that he\
  \ might ascertain for certain whether the ship was or was not the \u201CDuncan.\u201D\
  \ The Scotch yacht was also rigged as a brig. The question was, whether a chimney\
  \ could be discerned between the two masts of the vessel, which was now at a distance\
  \ of only five miles.</p>"
- <p>The horizon was still very clear. The examination was easy, and Ayrton soon let
  the glass fall again, saying?</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is not the ?Duncan\u2019! It could not be!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft again brought the brig within the range of the telescope, and could\
  \ see that she was of between three and four hundred tons burden, wonderfully narrow,\
  \ well\u2011masted, admirably built, and must be a very rapid sailer. But to what\
  \ nation did she belong? That was difficult to say.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd yet,\u201D added the sailor, \u201Ca flag is floating from her peak,\
  \ but I cannot distinguish the colors of it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn half an hour we shall be certain about that,\u201D answered the reporter.\
  \ \u201CBesides, it is very evident that the intention of the captain of this ship\
  \ is to land, and, consequently, if not today, to\u2011morrow at the latest, we\
  \ shall make his acquaintance.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNever mind!\u201D said Pencroft. \u201CIt is best to know whom we have\
  \ to deal with, and I shall not be sorry to recognize that fellow\u2019s colors!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>And, while thus speaking, the sailor never left the glass. The day began to\
  \ fade, and with the day the breeze fell also. The brig\u2019s ensign hung in folds,\
  \ and it became more and more difficult to observe it.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is not the American flag,\u201D said Pencroft from time to time, \u201C\
  nor the English, the red of which could be easily seen, nor the French or German\
  \ colors, nor the white flag of Russia, nor the yellow of Spain. One would say it\
  \ was all one color. Let\u2019s see: in these seas, what do we generally meet with?\
  \ The Chilean flag??but that is tri\u2011color. Brazilian??it is green. Japanese??it\
  \ is yellow and black, while this?\u201D</p>"
- <p>At that moment the breeze blew out the unknown flag. Ayrton seizing the telescope
  which the sailor had put down, put it to his eye, and in a hoarse voice,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe black flag!\u201D he exclaimed.</p>"
- <p>And indeed the somber bunting was floating from the mast of the brig, and they
  had now good reason for considering her to be a suspicious vessel!</p>
- "<p>Had the engineer, then, been right in his presentiments? Was this a pirate vessel?\
  \ Did she scour the Pacific, competing with the Malay proas which still infest it?\
  \ For what had she come to look at the shores of Lincoln Island? Was it to them\
  \ an unknown island, ready to become a magazine for stolen cargoes? Had she come\
  \ to find on the coast a sheltered port for the winter months? Was the settlers\u2019\
  \ honest domain destined to be transformed into an infamous refuge?the headquarters\
  \ of the piracy of the Pacific?</p>"
- "<p>All these ideas instinctively presented themselves to the colonists\u2019 imaginations.\
  \ There was no doubt, besides, of the signification which must be attached to the\
  \ color of the hoisted flag. It was that of pirates! It was that which the \u201C\
  Duncan\u201D would have carried, had the convicts succeeded in their criminal design!\
  \ No time was lost before discussing it.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy friends,\u201D said Cyrus Harding, \u201Cperhaps this vessel only wishes\
  \ to survey the coast of the island. Perhaps her crew will not land. There is a\
  \ chance of it. However that may be, we ought to do everything we can to hide our\
  \ presence here. The windmill on Prospect Heights is too easily seen. Let Ayrton\
  \ and Neb go and take down the sails. We must also conceal the windows of Granite\
  \ House with thick branches. All the fires must be extinguished, so that nothing\
  \ may betray the presence of men on the island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd our vessel?\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh,\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201Cshe is sheltered in Port Balloon, and\
  \ I defy any of those rascals there to find her!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The engineer\u2019s orders were immediately executed. Neb and Ayrton ascended\
  \ the plateau, and took the necessary precautions to conceal any indication of a\
  \ settlement. While they were thus occupied, their companions went to the border\
  \ of Jacamar Wood, and brought back a large quantity of branches and creepers, which\
  \ would at some distance appear as natural foliage, and thus disguise the windows\
  \ in the granite cliff. At the same time, the ammunition and guns were placed ready\
  \ so as to be at hand in case of an unexpected attack.</p>"
- <p>When all these precautions had been taken,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friends,\u201D said Harding, and his voice betrayed some emotion, \u201C\
  if the wretches endeavor to seize Lincoln Island, we shall defend it?shall we not?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Cyrus,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Cand if necessary we will\
  \ die to defend it!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The engineer extended his hand to his companions, who pressed it warmly. Ayrton
  remained in his corner, not joining the colonists. Perhaps he, the former convict,
  still felt himself unworthy to do so!</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in Ayrton\u2019s mind, and going to\
  \ him?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd you, Ayrton,\u201D he asked, \u201Cwhat will you do?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy duty,\u201D answered Ayrton.</p>"
- <p>He then took up his station near the window and gazed through the foliage.</p>
- "<p>It was now half\u2011past seven. The sun had disappeared twenty minutes ago\
  \ behind Granite House. Consequently the Eastern horizon was becoming obscured.\
  \ In the meanwhile the brig continued to advance towards Union Bay. She was now\
  \ not more than two miles off, and exactly opposite the plateau of Prospect Heights,\
  \ for after having tacked off Claw Cape, she had drifted towards the north in the\
  \ current of the rising tide. One might have said that at this distance she had\
  \ already entered the vast bay, for a straight line drawn from Claw Cape to Cape\
  \ Mandible would have rested on her starboard quarter.</p>"
- <p>Was the brig about to penetrate far into the bay? That was the first question.
  When once in the bay, would she anchor there? That was the second. Would she not
  content herself with only surveying the coast, and stand out to sea again without
  landing her crew? They would know this in an hour. The colonists could do nothing
  but wait.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding had not seen the suspected vessel hoist the black flag without
  deep anxiety. Was it not a direct menace against the work which he and his companions
  had till now conducted so successfully? Had these pirates?for the sailors of the
  brig could be nothing else?already visited the island, since on approaching it they
  had hoisted their colors. Had they formerly invaded it, so that certain unaccountable
  peculiarities might be explained in this way? Did there exist in the as yet unexplored
  parts some accomplice ready to enter into communication with them?</p>
- <p>To all these questions which he mentally asked himself, Harding knew not what
  to reply; but he felt that the safety of the colony could not but be seriously threatened
  by the arrival of the brig.</p>
- <p>However, he and his companions were determined to fight to the last gasp. It
  would have been very important to know if the pirates were numerous and better armed
  than the colonists. But how was this information to be obtained?</p>
- <p>Night fell. The new moon had disappeared. Profound darkness enveloped the island
  and the sea. No light could pierce through the heavy piles of clouds on the horizon.
  The wind had died away completely with the twilight. Not a leaf rustled on the trees,
  not a ripple murmured on the shore. Nothing could be seen of the ship, all her lights
  being extinguished, and if she was still in sight of the island, her whereabouts
  could not be discovered.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell! who knows?\u201D said Pencroft. \u201CPerhaps that cursed craft\
  \ will stand off during the night, and we shall see nothing of her at daybreak.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>As if in reply to the sailor\u2019s observation, a bright light flashed in the\
  \ darkness, and a cannon\u2011shot was heard.</p>"
- <p>The vessel was still there and had guns on board.</p>
- <p>Six seconds elapsed between the flash and the report.</p>
- <p>Therefore the brig was about a mile and a quarter from the coast.</p>
- "<p>At the same time, the chains were heard rattling through the hawse\u2011holes.</p>"
- <p>The vessel had just anchored in sight of Granite House!</p>
- <p>Chapter 2</p>
- "<p>There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates\u2019 intentions. They had dropped\
  \ anchor at a short distance from the island, and it was evident that the next day\
  \ by means of their boats they purposed to land on the beach!</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions were ready to act, but, determined though they
  were, they must not forget to be prudent. Perhaps their presence might still be
  concealed in the event of the pirates contenting themselves with landing on the
  shore without examining the interior of the island. It might be, indeed, that their
  only intention was to obtain fresh water from the Mercy, and it was not impossible
  that the bridge, thrown across a mile and a half from the mouth, and the manufactory
  at the Chimneys might escape their notice.</p>
- "<p>But why was that flag hoisted at the brig\u2019s peak? What was that shot fired\
  \ for? Pure bravado doubtless, unless it was a sign of the act of taking possession.\
  \ Harding knew now that the vessel was well armed. And what had the colonists of\
  \ Lincoln Island to reply to the pirates\u2019 guns? A few muskets only.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHowever,\u201D observed Cyrus Harding, \u201Chere we are in an impregnable\
  \ position. The enemy cannot discover the mouth of the outlet, now that it is hidden\
  \ under reeds and grass, and consequently it would be impossible for them to penetrate\
  \ into Granite House.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut our plantations, our poultry\u2011yard, our corral, all, everything!\u201D\
  \ exclaimed Pencroft, stamping his foot. \u201CThey may spoil everything, destroy\
  \ everything in a few hours!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CEverything, Pencroft,\u201D answered Harding, \u201Cand we have no means\
  \ of preventing them.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAre they numerous? that is the question,\u201D said the reporter. \u201C\
  If they are not more than a dozen, we shall be able to stop them, but forty, fifty,\
  \ more perhaps!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Harding,\u201D then said Ayrton, advancing towards the engineer,\
  \ \u201Cwill you give me leave?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFor what, my friend?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo go to that vessel to find out the strength of her crew.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut Ayrton?\u201D answered the engineer, hesitating, \u201Cyou will risk\
  \ your life?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy not, sir?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is more than your duty.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI have more than my duty to do,\u201D replied Ayrton.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWill you go to the ship in the boat?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, sir, but I will swim. A boat would be seen where a man may glide between\
  \ wind and water.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDo you know that the brig is a mile and a quarter from the shore?\u201D\
  \ said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am a good swimmer, Mr. Herbert.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI tell you it is risking your life,\u201D said the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is no matter,\u201D answered Ayrton. \u201CCaptain Harding, I ask\
  \ this as a favor. Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own eyes!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CGo, Ayrton,\u201D replied the engineer, who felt sure that a refusal would\
  \ have deeply wounded the former convict, now become an honest man.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI will accompany you,\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou mistrust me!\u201D said Ayrton quickly.</p>"
- <p>Then more humbly,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CAlas!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo! no!\u201D exclaimed Harding with animation, \u201Cno, Ayrton, Pencroft\
  \ does not mistrust you. You interpret his words wrongly.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIndeed,\u201D returned the sailor, \u201CI only propose to accompany Ayrton\
  \ as far as the islet. It may be, although it is scarcely possible, that one of\
  \ these villains has landed, and in that case two men will not be too many to hinder\
  \ him from giving the alarm. I will wait for Ayrton on the islet, and he shall go\
  \ alone to the vessel, since he has proposed to do so.\u201D These things agreed\
  \ to, Ayrton made preparations for his departure. His plan was bold, but it might\
  \ succeed, thanks to the darkness of the night. Once arrived at the vessel\u2019\
  s side, Ayrton, holding on to the main chains, might reconnoiter the number and\
  \ perhaps overhear the intentions of the pirates.</p>"
- <p>Ayrton and Pencroft, followed by their companions, descended to the beach. Ayrton
  undressed and rubbed himself with grease, so as to suffer less from the temperature
  of the water, which was still cold. He might, indeed, be obliged to remain in it
  for several hours.</p>
- <p>Pencroft and Neb, during this time, had gone to fetch the boat, moored a few
  hundred feet higher up, on the bank of the Mercy, and by the time they returned,
  Ayrton was ready to start. A coat was thrown over his shoulders, and the settlers
  all came round him to press his hand.</p>
- <p>Ayrton then shoved off with Pencroft in the boat.</p>
- "<p>It was half\u2011past ten in the evening when the two adventurers disappeared\
  \ in the darkness. Their companions returned to wait at the Chimneys.</p>"
- <p>The channel was easily traversed, and the boat touched the opposite shore of
  the islet. This was not done without precaution, for fear lest the pirates might
  be roaming about there. But after a careful survey, it was evident that the islet
  was deserted. Ayrton then, followed by Pencroft, crossed it with a rapid step, scaring
  the birds nestled in the holes of the rocks; then, without hesitating, he plunged
  into the sea, and swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship, in which a few
  lights had recently appeared, showing her exact situation. As to Pencroft, he crouched
  down in a cleft of the rock, and awaited the return of his companion.</p>
- <p>In the meanwhile, Ayrton, swimming with a vigorous stroke, glided through the
  sheet of water without producing the slightest ripple. His head just emerged above
  it and his eyes were fixed on the dark hull of the brig, from which the lights were
  reflected in the water. He thought only of the duty which he had promised to accomplish,
  and nothing of the danger which he ran, not only on board the ship, but in the sea,
  often frequented by sharks. The current bore him along and he rapidly receded from
  the shore.</p>
- "<p>Half an hour afterwards, Ayrton, without having been either seen or heard, arrived\
  \ at the ship and caught hold of the main\u2011chains. He took breath, then, hoisting\
  \ himself up, he managed to reach the extremity of the cutwater. There were drying\
  \ several pairs of sailors\u2019 trousers. He put on a pair. Then settling himself\
  \ firmly, he listened. They were not sleeping on board the brig. On the contrary,\
  \ they were talking, singing, laughing. And these were the sentences, accompanied\
  \ with oaths, which principally struck Ayrton:?</p>"
- "<p>\u201COur brig is a famous acquisition.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CShe sails well, and merits her name of the ?Speedy.\u201C</p>"
- "<p>\u201CShe would show all the navy of Norfolk a clean pair of heels.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHurrah for her captain!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHurrah for Bob Harvey!\u201D</p>"
- <p>What Ayrton felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation may be understood
  when it is known that in this Bob Harvey he recognized one of his old Australian
  companions, a daring sailor, who had continued his criminal career. Bob Harvey had
  seized, on the shores of Norfolk Island this brig, which was loaded with arms, ammunition,
  utensils, and tools of all sorts, destined for one of the Sandwich Islands. All
  his gang had gone on board, and pirates after having been convicts, these wretches,
  more ferocious than the Malays themselves, scoured the Pacific, destroying vessels,
  and massacring their crews.</p>
- "<p>The convicts spoke loudly, they recounted their deeds, drinking deeply at the\
  \ same time, and this is what Ayrton gathered. The actual crew of the \u201CSpeedy\u201D\
  \ was composed solely of English prisoners, escaped from Norfolk Island.</p>"
- "<p>Here it may be well to explain what this island was. In 29deg 2\u2019 south\
  \ latitude, and 165deg 42\u2019 east longitude, to the east of Australia, is found\
  \ a little island, six miles in circumference, overlooked by Mount Pitt, which rises\
  \ to a height of 1,100 feet above the level of the sea. This is Norfolk Island,\
  \ once the seat of an establishment in which were lodged the most intractable convicts\
  \ from the English penitentiaries. They numbered 500, under an iron discipline,\
  \ threatened with terrible punishments, and were guarded by 150 soldiers, and 150\
  \ employed under the orders of the governor. It would be difficult to imagine a\
  \ collection of greater ruffians. Sometimes,?although very rarely,?notwithstanding\
  \ the extreme surveillance of which they were the object, many managed to escape,\
  \ and seizing vessels which they surprised, they infested the Polynesian Archipelagoes.</p>"
- "<p>Thus had Bob Harvey and his companions done. Thus had Ayrton formerly wished\
  \ to do. Bob Harvey had seized the brig \u201CSpeedy,\u201D anchored in sight of\
  \ Norfolk Island; the crew had been massacred; and for a year this ship had scoured\
  \ the Pacific, under the command of Harvey, now a pirate, and well known to Ayrton!</p>"
- <p>The convicts were, for the most part, assembled under the poop; but a few, stretched
  on the deck, were talking loudly.</p>
- "<p>The conversation still continued amid shouts and libations. Ayrton learned that\
  \ chance alone had brought the \u201CSpeedy\u201D in sight of Lincoln Island; Bob\
  \ Harvey had never yet set foot on it; but, as Cyrus Harding had conjectured, finding\
  \ this unknown land in his course, its position being marked on no chart, he had\
  \ formed the project of visiting it, and, if he found it suitable, of making it\
  \ the brig\u2019s headquarters.</p>"
- "<p>As to the black flag hoisted at the \u201CSpeedy\u2019s\u201D peak, and the\
  \ gun which had been fired, in imitation of men\u2011of\u2011war when they lower\
  \ their colors, it was pure piratical bravado. It was in no way a signal, and no\
  \ communication yet existed between the convicts and Lincoln Island.</p>"
- "<p>The settlers\u2019 domain was now menaced with terrible danger. Evidently the\
  \ island, with its water, its harbor, its resources of all kinds so increased in\
  \ value by the colonists, and the concealment afforded by Granite House, could not\
  \ but be convenient for the convicts; in their hands it would become an excellent\
  \ place of refuge, and, being unknown, it would assure them, for a long time perhaps,\
  \ impunity and security. Evidently, also, the lives of the settlers would not be\
  \ respected, and Bob Harvey and his accomplices\u2019 first care would be to massacre\
  \ them without mercy. Harding and his companions had, therefore, not even the choice\
  \ of flying and hiding themselves in the island, since the convicts intended to\
  \ reside there, and since, in the event of the \u201CSpeedy\u201D departing on an\
  \ expedition, it was probable that some of the crew would remain on shore, so as\
  \ to settle themselves there. Therefore, it would be necessary to fight, to destroy\
  \ every one of these scoundrels, unworthy of pity, and against whom any means would\
  \ be right. So thought Ayrton, and he well knew that Cyrus Harding would be of his\
  \ way of thinking.</p>"
- <p>But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible? That would depend
  on the equipment of the brig, and the number of men which she carried.</p>
- "<p>This Ayrton resolved to learn at any cost, and as an hour after his arrival\
  \ the vociferations had begun to die away, and as a large number of the convicts\
  \ were already buried in a drunken sleep, Ayrton did not hesitate to venture onto\
  \ the \u201CSpeedy\u2019s\u201D deck, which the extinguished lanterns now left in\
  \ total darkness. He hoisted himself onto the cutwater, and by the bowsprit arrived\
  \ at the forecastle. Then, gliding among the convicts stretched here and there,\
  \ he made the round of the ship, and found that the \u201CSpeedy\u201D carried four\
  \ guns, which would throw shot of from eight to ten pounds in weight. He found also,\
  \ on touching them that these guns were breech\u2011loaders. They were therefore,\
  \ of modern make, easily used, and of terrible effect.</p>"
- "<p>As to the men lying on the deck, they were about ten in number, but it was to\
  \ be supposed that more were sleeping down below. Besides, by listening to them,\
  \ Ayrton had understood that there were fifty on board. That was a large number\
  \ for the six settlers of Lincoln Island to contend with! But now, thanks to Ayrton\u2019\
  s devotion, Cyrus Harding would not be surprised, he would know the strength of\
  \ his adversaries, and would make his arrangements accordingly.</p>"
- "<p>There was nothing more for Ayrton to do but to return, and render to his companions\
  \ an account of the mission with which he had charged himself, and he prepared to\
  \ regain the bows of the brig, so that he might let himself down into the water.\
  \ But to this man, whose wish was, as he had said, to do more than his duty, there\
  \ came an heroic thought. This was to sacrifice his own life, but save the island\
  \ and the colonists. Cyrus Harding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians, all\
  \ well armed, who, either by penetrating by main force into Granite House, or by\
  \ starving out the besieged, could obtain from them what they wanted. And then he\
  \ thought of his preservers?those who had made him again a man, and an honest mm,\
  \ those to whom he owed all?murdered without pity, their works destroyed, their\
  \ island turned into a pirates\u2019 den! He said to himself that he, Ayrton, was\
  \ the principal cause of so many disasters, since his old companion, Bob Harvey,\
  \ had but realized his own plans, and a feeling of horror took possession of him.\
  \ Then he was seized with an irresistible desire to blow up the brig and with her,\
  \ all whom she had on board. He would perish in the explosion, but he would have\
  \ done his duty.</p>"
- "<p>Ayrton did not hesitate. To reach the powder\u2011room, which is always situated\
  \ in the after\u2011part of a vessel, was easy. There would be no want of powder\
  \ in a vessel which followed such a trade, and a spark would be enough to destroy\
  \ it in an instant.</p>"
- "<p>Ayrton stole carefully along the between\u2011decks, strewn with numerous sleepers,\
  \ overcome more by drunkenness than sleep. A lantern was lighted at the foot of\
  \ the mainmast, round which was hung a gun\u2011rack, furnished with weapons of\
  \ all sorts.</p>"
- "<p>Ayrton took a revolver from the rack, and assured himself that it was loaded\
  \ and primed. Nothing more was needed to accomplish the work of destruction. He\
  \ then glided towards the stern, so as to arrive under the brig\u2019s poop at the\
  \ powder\u2011magazine.</p>"
- "<p>It was difficult to proceed along the dimly lighted deck without stumbling over\
  \ some half\u2011sleeping convict, who retorted by oaths and kicks. Ayrton was,\
  \ therefore, more than once obliged to halt. But at last he arrived at the partition\
  \ dividing the aftercabin, and found the door opening into the magazine itself.</p>"
- <p>Ayrton, compelled to force it open, set to work. It was a difficult operation
  to perform without noise, for he had to break a padlock. But under his vigorous
  hand, the padlock broke, and the door was open.</p>
- "<p>At that moment a hand was laid on Ayrton\u2019s shoulder.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat are you doing here?\u201D asked a tall man, in a harsh voice, who,\
  \ standing in the shadow, quickly threw the light of a lantern in Ayrton\u2019s\
  \ face.</p>"
- <p>Ayrton drew back. In the rapid flash of the lantern, he had recognized his former
  accomplice, Bob Harvey, who could not have known him, as he must have thought Ayrton
  long since dead.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat are you doing here?\u201D again said Bob Harvey, seizing Ayrton by\
  \ the waistband.</p>"
- "<p>But Ayrton, without replying, wrenched himself from his grasp and attempted\
  \ to rush into the magazine. A shot fired into the midst of the powder\u2011casks,\
  \ and all would be over!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHelp, lads!\u201D shouted Bob Harvey.</p>"
- <p>At his shout two or three pirates awoke, jumped up, and, rushing on Ayrton, endeavored
  to throw him down. He soon extricated himself from their grasp. He fired his revolver,
  and two of the convicts fell, but a blow from a knife which he could not ward off
  made a gash in his shoulder.</p>
- "<p>Ayrton perceived that he could no longer hope to carry out his project. Bob\
  \ Harvey had reclosed the door of the powder\u2011magazine, and a movement on the\
  \ deck indicated a general awakening of the pirates. Ayrton must reserve himself\
  \ to fight at the side of Cyrus Harding. There was nothing for him but flight!</p>"
- <p>But was flight still possible? It was doubtful, yet Ayrton resolved to dare everything
  in order to rejoin his companions.</p>
- "<p>Four barrels of the revolver were still undischarged. Two were fired?one, aimed\
  \ at Bob Harvey, did not wound him, or at any rate only slightly, and Ayrton, profiting\
  \ by the momentary retreat of his adversaries, rushed towards the companion\u2011\
  ladder to gain the deck. Passing before the lantern, he smashed it with a blow from\
  \ the butt of his revolver. A profound darkness ensued, which favored his flight.\
  \ Two or three pirates, awakened by the noise, were descending the ladder at the\
  \ same moment.</p>"
- <p>A fifth shot from Ayrton laid one low, and the others drew back, not understanding
  what was going on. Ayrton was on deck in two bounds, and three seconds later, having
  discharged his last barrel in the face of a pirate who was about to seize him by
  the throat, he leaped over the bulwarks into the sea.</p>
- <p>Ayrton had not made six strokes before shots were splashing around him like hail.</p>
- "<p>What were Pencroft\u2019s feelings, sheltered under a rock on the islet! What\
  \ were those of Harding, the reporter, Herbert, and Neb, crouched in the Chimneys,\
  \ when they heard the reports on board the brig! They rushed out on to the beach,\
  \ and, their guns shouldered, they stood ready to repel any attack.</p>"
- <p>They had no doubt about it themselves! Ayrton, surprised by the pirates, had
  been murdered, and, perhaps, the wretches would profit by the night to make a descent
  on the island!</p>
- <p>Half an hour was passed in terrible anxiety. The firing had ceased, and yet neither
  Ayrton nor Pencroft had reappeared. Was the islet invaded? Ought they not to fly
  to the help of Ayrton and Pencroft? But how? The tide being high at that time, rendered
  the channel impassable. The boat was not there! We may imagine the horrible anxiety
  which took possession of Harding and his companions!</p>
- "<p>At last, towards half\u2011past twelve, a boat, carrying two men, touched the\
  \ beach. It was Ayrton, slightly wounded in the shoulder, and Pencroft, safe and\
  \ sound, whom their friends received with open arms.</p>"
- <p>All immediately took refuge in the Chimneys. There Ayrton recounted all that
  had passed, even to his plan for blowing up the brig, which he had attempted to
  put into execution.</p>
- <p>All hands were extended to Ayrton, who did not conceal from them that their situation
  was serious. The pirates had been alarmed. They knew that Lincoln Island was inhabited.
  They would land upon it in numbers and well armed. They would respect nothing. Should
  the settlers fall into their hands, they must expect no mercy!</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, we shall know how to die!\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us go in and watch,\u201D answered the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHave we any chance of escape, captain?\u201D asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHum! six against fifty!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes! six! without counting?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus did not reply, but pointed upwards.</p>
- <p>Chapter 3</p>
- <p>The night passed without incident. The colonists were on the qui vive, and did
  not leave their post at the Chimneys. The pirates, on their side, did not appear
  to have made any attempt to land. Since the last shots fired at Ayrton not a report,
  not even a sound, had betrayed the presence of the brig in the neighborhood of the
  island. It might have been fancied that she had weighed anchor, thinking that she
  had to deal with her match, and had left the coast.</p>
- "<p>But it was no such thing, and when day began to dawn the settlers could see\
  \ a confused mass through the morning mist. It was the \u201CSpeedy.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThese, my friends,\u201D said the engineer, \u201Care the arrangements\
  \ which appear to me best to make before the fog completely clears away. It hides\
  \ us from the eyes of the pirates, and we can act without attracting their attention.\
  \ The most important thing is, that the convicts should believe that the inhabitants\
  \ of the island are numerous, and consequently capable of resisting them. I therefore\
  \ propose that we divide into three parties. The first of which shall be posted\
  \ at the Chimneys, the second at the mouth of the Mercy. As to the third, I think\
  \ it would be best to place it on the islet, so as to prevent, or at all events\
  \ delay, any attempt at landing. We have the use of two rifles and four muskets.\
  \ Each of us will be armed, and, as we are amply provided with powder and shot,\
  \ we need not spare our fire. We have nothing to fear from the muskets nor even\
  \ from the guns of the brig. What can they do against these rocks? And, as we shall\
  \ not fire from the windows of Granite House, the pirates will not think of causing\
  \ irreparable damage by throwing shell against it. What is to be feared is, the\
  \ necessity of meeting hand\u2011to\u2011hand, since the convicts have numbers on\
  \ their side. We must therefore try to prevent them from landing, but without discovering\
  \ ourselves. Therefore, do not economize the ammunition. Fire often, but with a\
  \ sure aim. We have each eight or ten enemies to kill, and they must be killed!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding had clearly represented their situation, although he spoke in the
  calmest voice, as if it was a question of directing a piece of work and not ordering
  a battle. His companions approved these arrangements without even uttering a word.
  There was nothing more to be done but for each to take his place before the fog
  should be completely dissipated. Neb and Pencroft immediately ascended to Granite
  House and brought back a sufficient quantity of ammunition. Gideon Spilett and Ayrton,
  both very good marksmen, were armed with the two rifles, which carried nearly a
  mile. The four other muskets were divided among Harding, Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert.</p>
- <p>The posts were arranged in the following manner:?</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and Herbert remained in ambush at the Chimneys, thus commanding
  the shore to the foot of Granite House.</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett and Neb crouched among the rocks at the mouth of the Mercy, from
  which the drawbridges had been raised, so as to prevent any one from crossing in
  a boat or landing on the opposite shore.</p>
- <p>As to Ayrton and Pencroft, they shoved off in the boat, and prepared to cross
  the channel and to take up two separate stations on the islet. In this way, shots
  being fired from four different points at once, the convicts would be led to believe
  that the island was both largely peopled and strongly defended.</p>
- "<p>In the event of a landing being effected without their having been able to prevent\
  \ it, and also if they saw that they were on the point of being cut off by the brig\u2019\
  s boat, Ayrton and Pencroft were to return in their boat to the shore and proceed\
  \ towards the threatened spot.</p>"
- "<p>Before starting to occupy their posts, the colonists for the last time wrung\
  \ each other\u2019s hands.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft succeeded in controlling himself sufficiently to suppress his emotion
  when he embraced Herbert, his boy! and then they separated.</p>
- <p>In a few moments Harding and Herbert on one side, the reporter and Neb on the
  other, had disappeared behind the rocks, and five minutes later Ayrton and Pencroft,
  having without difficulty crossed the channel, disembarked on the islet and concealed
  themselves in the clefts of its eastern shore.</p>
- <p>None of them could have been seen, for they themselves could scarcely distinguish
  the brig in the fog.</p>
- "<p>It was half\u2011past six in the morning.</p>"
- <p>Soon the fog began to clear away, and the topmasts of the brig issued from the
  vapor. For some minutes great masses rolled over the surface of the sea, then a
  breeze sprang up, which rapidly dispelled the mist.</p>
- "<p>The \u201CSpeedy\u201D now appeared in full view, with a spring on her cable,\
  \ her head to the north, presenting her larboard side to the island. Just as Harding\
  \ had calculated, she was not more than a mile and a quarter from the coast.</p>"
- <p>The sinister black flag floated from the peak.</p>
- "<p>The engineer, with his telescope, could see that the four guns on board were\
  \ pointed at the island. They were evidently ready to fire at a moment\u2019s notice.</p>"
- "<p>In the meanwhile the \u201CSpeedy\u201D remained silent. About thirty pirates\
  \ could be seen moving on the deck. A few more on the poop; two others posted in\
  \ the shrouds, and armed with spyglasses, were attentively surveying the island.</p>"
- "<p>Certainly, Bob Harvey and his crew would not be able easily to give an account\
  \ of what had happened during the night on board the brig. Had this half\u2011naked\
  \ man, who had forced the door of the powder\u2011magazine, and with whom they had\
  \ struggled, who had six times discharged his revolver at them, who had killed one\
  \ and wounded two others, escaped their shot? Had he been able to swim to shore?\
  \ Whence did he come? What had been his object? Had his design really been to blow\
  \ up the brig, as Bob Harvey had thought? All this must be confused enough to the\
  \ convicts\u2019 minds. But what they could no longer doubt was that the unknown\
  \ island before which the \u201CSpeedy\u201D had cast anchor was inhabited, and\
  \ that there was, perhaps, a numerous colony ready to defend it. And yet no one\
  \ was to be seen, neither on the shore, nor on the heights. The beach appeared to\
  \ be absolutely deserted. At any rate, there was no trace of dwellings. Had the\
  \ inhabitants fled into the interior? Thus probably the pirate captain reasoned,\
  \ and doubtless, like a prudent man, he wished to reconnoiter the locality before\
  \ he allowed his men to venture there.</p>"
- <p>During an hour and a half, no indication of attack or landing could be observed
  on board the brig. Evidently Bob Harvey was hesitating. Even with his strongest
  telescopes he could not have perceived one of the settlers crouched among the rocks.
  It was not even probable that his attention had been awakened by the screen of green
  branches and creepers hiding the windows of Granite House, and showing rather conspicuously
  on the bare rock. Indeed, how could he imagine that a dwelling was hollowed out,
  at that height, in the solid granite? From Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, in all
  the extent of Union Bay, there was nothing to lead him to suppose that the island
  was or could be inhabited.</p>
- "<p>At eight o\u2019clock, however, the colonists observed a movement on board the\
  \ \u201CSpeedy.\u201D A boat was lowered, and seven men jumped into her. They were\
  \ armed with muskets; one took the yoke\u2011lines, four others the oars, and the\
  \ two others, kneeling in the bows, ready to fire, reconnoitered the island. Their\
  \ object was no doubt to make an examination but not to land, for in the latter\
  \ case they would have come in larger numbers. The pirates from their look\u2011\
  out could have seen that the coast was sheltered by an islet, separated from it\
  \ by a channel half a mile in width. However, it was soon evident to Cyrus Harding,\
  \ on observing the direction followed by the boat, that they would not attempt to\
  \ penetrate into the channel, but would land on the islet.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft and Ayrton, each hidden in a narrow cleft of the rock, saw them coming
  directly towards them, and waited till they were within range.</p>
- "<p>The boat advanced with extreme caution. The oars only dipped into the water\
  \ at long intervals. It could now be seen that one of the convicts held a lead\u2011\
  line in his hand, and that he wished to fathom the depth of the channel hollowed\
  \ out by the current of the Mercy. This showed that it was Bob Harvey\u2019s intention\
  \ to bring his brig as near as possible to the coast. About thirty pirates, scattered\
  \ in the rigging, followed every movement of the boat, and took the bearings of\
  \ certain landmarks which would allow them to approach without danger. The boat\
  \ was not more than two cables\u2011lengths off the islet when she stopped. The\
  \ man at the tiller stood up and looked for the best place at which to land.</p>"
- "<p>At that moment two shots were heard. Smoke curled up from among the rocks of\
  \ the islet. The man at the helm and the man with the lead\u2011line fell backwards\
  \ into the boat. Ayrton\u2019s and Pencroft\u2019s balls had struck them both at\
  \ the same moment.</p>"
- "<p>Almost immediately a louder report was heard, a cloud of smoke issued from the\
  \ brig\u2019s side, and a ball, striking the summit of the rock which sheltered\
  \ Ayrton and Pencroft, made it fly in splinters, but the two marksmen remained unhurt.</p>"
- <p>Horrible imprecations burst from the boat, which immediately continued its way.
  The man who had been at the tiller was replaced by one of his comrades, and the
  oars were rapidly plunged into the water. However, instead of returning on board
  as might have been expected, the boat coasted along the islet, so as to round its
  southern point. The pirates pulled vigorously at their oars that they might get
  out of range of the bullets.</p>
- "<p>They advanced to within five cables\u2011lengths of that part of the shore terminated\
  \ by Flotsam Point, and after having rounded it in a semicircular line, still protected\
  \ by the brig\u2019s guns, they proceeded towards the mouth of the Mercy.</p>"
- <p>Their evident intention was to penetrate into the channel, and cut off the colonists
  posted on the islet, in such a way, that whatever their number might be, being placed
  between the fire from the boat and the fire from the brig, they would find themselves
  in a very disadvantageous position.</p>
- <p>A quarter of an hour passed while the boat advanced in this direction. Absolute
  silence, perfect calm reigned in the air and on the water.</p>
- "<p>Pencroft and Ayrton, although they knew they ran the risk of being cut off,\
  \ had not left their post, both that they did not wish to show themselves as yet\
  \ to their assailants, and expose themselves to the \u201CSpeedy\u2019s\u201D guns,\
  \ and that they relied on Neb and Gideon Spilett, watching at the mouth of the river,\
  \ and on Cyrus Harding and Herbert, in ambush among the rocks at the Chimneys.</p>"
- "<p>Twenty minutes after the first shots were fired, the boat was less than two\
  \ cables\u2011lengths off the Mercy. As the tide was beginning to rise with its\
  \ accustomed violence, caused by the narrowness of the straits, the pirates were\
  \ drawn towards the river, and it was only by dint of hard rowing that they were\
  \ able to keep in the middle of the channel. But, as they were passing within good\
  \ range of the mouth of the Mercy, two balls saluted them, and two more of their\
  \ number were laid in the bottom of the boat. Neb and Spilett had not missed their\
  \ aim.</p>"
- <p>The brig immediately sent a second ball on the post betrayed by the smoke, but
  without any other result than that of splintering the rock.</p>
- <p>The boat now contained only three able men. Carried on by the current, it shot
  through the channel with the rapidity of an arrow, passed before Harding and Herbert,
  who, not thinking it within range, withheld their fire, then, rounding the northern
  point of the islet with the two remaining oars, they pulled towards the brig.</p>
- <p>Hitherto the settlers had nothing to complain of. Their adversaries had certainly
  had the worst of it. The latter already counted four men seriously wounded if not
  dead; they, on the contrary, unwounded, had not missed a shot. If the pirates continued
  to attack them in this way, if they renewed their attempt to land by means of a
  boat, they could be destroyed one by one.</p>
- "<p>It was now seen how advantageous the engineer\u2019s arrangements had been.\
  \ The pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous and well\u2011armed\
  \ adversaries, whom they could not easily get the better of.</p>"
- "<p>Half an hour passed before the boat, having to pull against the current, could\
  \ get alongside the \u201CSpeedy.\u201D Frightful cries were heard when they returned\
  \ on board with the wounded, and two or three guns were fired with no results.</p>"
- "<p>But now about a dozen other convicts, maddened with rage, and possibly by the\
  \ effect of the evening\u2019s potations, threw themselves into the boat. A second\
  \ boat was also lowered, in which eight men took their places, and while the first\
  \ pulled straight for the islet, to dislodge the colonists from thence the second\
  \ maneuvered so as to force the entrance of the Mercy.</p>"
- <p>The situation was evidently becoming very dangerous for Pencroft and Ayrton,
  and they saw that they must regain the mainland.</p>
- "<p>However, they waited till the first boat was within range, when two well\u2011\
  directed balls threw its crew into disorder. Then, Pencroft and Ayrton, abandoning\
  \ their posts, under fire from the dozen muskets, ran across the islet at full speed,\
  \ jumped into their boat, crossed the channel at the moment the second boat reached\
  \ the southern end, and ran to hide themselves in the Chimneys.</p>"
- <p>They had scarcely rejoined Cyrus Harding and Herbert, before the islet was overrun
  with pirates in every direction. Almost at the same moment, fresh reports resounded
  from the Mercy station, to which the second boat was rapidly approaching. Two, out
  of the eight men who manned her, were mortally wounded by Gideon Spilett and Neb,
  and the boat herself, carried irresistibly onto the reefs, was stove in at the mouth
  of the Mercy. But the six survivors, holding their muskets above their heads to
  preserve them from contact with the water, managed to land on the right bank of
  the river. Then, finding they were exposed to the fire of the ambush there, they
  fled in the direction of Flotsam Point, out of range of the balls.</p>
- '<p>The actual situation was this: on the islet were a dozen convicts, of whom some
  were no doubt wounded, but who had still a boat at their disposal; on the island
  were six, but who could not by any possibility reach Granite House, as they could
  not cross the river, all the bridges being raised.</p>'
- "<p>\u201CHallo,\u201D exclaimed Pencroft as he rushed into the Chimneys, \u201C\
  hallo, captain! What do you think of it, now?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI think,\u201D answered the engineer, \u201Cthat the combat will now take\
  \ a new form, for it cannot be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as\
  \ to remain in a position so unfavorable for them!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey won\u2019t cross the channel,\u201D said the sailor. \u201CAyrton\
  \ and Mr. Spilett\u2019s rifles are there to prevent them. You know that they carry\
  \ more than a mile!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo doubt,\u201D replied Herbert; \u201Cbut what can two rifles do against\
  \ the brig\u2019s guns?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, the brig isn\u2019t in the channel yet, I fancy!\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut suppose she does come there?\u201D said Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat\u2019s impossible, for she would risk running aground and being lost!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is possible,\u201D said Ayrton. \u201CThe convicts might profit by\
  \ the high tide to enter the channel, with the risk of grounding at low tide, it\
  \ is true; but then, under the fire from her guns, our posts would be no longer\
  \ tenable.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CConfound them!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201Cit really seems as if the\
  \ blackguards were preparing to weigh anchor.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps we shall be obliged to take refuge in Granite House!\u201D observed\
  \ Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe must wait!\u201D answered Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut Mr. Spilett and Neb?\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey will know when it is best to rejoin us. Be ready, Ayrton. It is yours\
  \ and Spilett\u2019s rifles which must speak now.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>It was only too true. The \u201CSpeedy\u201D was beginning to weigh her anchor,\
  \ and her intention was evidently to approach the islet. The tide would be rising\
  \ for an hour and a half, and the ebb current being already weakened, it would be\
  \ easy for the brig to advance. But as to entering the channel, Pencroft, contrary\
  \ to Ayrton\u2019s opinion, could not believe that she would dare to attempt it.</p>"
- <p>In the meanwhile, the pirates who occupied the islet had gradually advanced to
  the opposite shore, and were now only separated from the mainland by the channel.</p>
- "<p>Being armed with muskets alone, they could do no harm to the settlers, in ambush\
  \ at the Chimneys and the mouth of the Mercy; but, not knowing the latter to be\
  \ supplied with long\u2011range rifles, they on their side did not believe themselves\
  \ to be exposed. Quite uncovered, therefore, they surveyed the islet, and examined\
  \ the shore.</p>"
- "<p>Their illusion was of short duration. Ayrton\u2019s and Gideon Spilett\u2019\
  s rifles then spoke, and no doubt imparted some very disagreeable intelligence to\
  \ two of the convicts, for they fell backwards.</p>"
- "<p>Then there was a general helter\u2011skelter. The ten others, not even stopping\
  \ to pick up their dead or wounded companions, fled to the other side of the islet,\
  \ tumbled into the boat which had brought them, and pulled away with all their strength.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CEight less!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft. \u201CReally, one would have thought\
  \ that Mr. Spilett and Ayrton had given the word to fire together!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGentlemen,\u201D said Ayrton, as he reloaded his gun, \u201Cthis is becoming\
  \ more serious. The brig is making sail!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe anchor is weighed!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, and she is already moving.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>In fact, they could distinctly hear the creaking of the windlass. The \u201C\
  Speedy\u201D was at first held by her anchor; then, when that had been raised, she\
  \ began to drift towards the shore. The wind was blowing from the sea; the jib and\
  \ the foretopsail were hoisted, and the vessel gradually approached the island.</p>"
- "<p>From the two posts of the Mercy and the Chimneys they watched her without giving\
  \ a sign of life, but not without some emotion. What could be more terrible for\
  \ the colonists than to be exposed, at a short distance, to the brig\u2019s guns,\
  \ without being able to reply with any effect? How could they then prevent the pirates\
  \ from landing?</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding felt this strongly, and he asked himself what it would be possible
  to do. Before long, he would be called upon for his determination. But what was
  it to be? To shut themselves up in Granite House, to be besieged there, to remain
  there for weeks, for months even, since they had an abundance of provisions? So
  far good! But after that? The pirates would not the less be masters of the island,
  which they would ravage at their pleasure, and in time, they would end by having
  their revenge on the prisoners in Granite House.</p>
- <p>However, one chance yet remained; it was that Bob Harvey, after all, would not
  venture his ship into the channel, and that he would keep outside the islet. He
  would be still separated from the coast by half a mile, and at that distance his
  shot could not be very destructive.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNever!\u201D repeated Pencroft, \u201CBob Harvey will never, if he is\
  \ a good seaman, enter that channel! He knows well that it would risk the brig,\
  \ if the sea got up ever so little! And what would become of him without his vessel?\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>In the meanwhile the brig approached the islet, and it could be seen that she
  was endeavoring to make the lower end. The breeze was light, and as the current
  had then lost much of its force, Bob Harvey had absolute command over his vessel.</p>
- <p>The route previously followed by the boats had allowed her to reconnoiter the
  channel, and she boldly entered it.</p>
- "<p>The pirate\u2019s design was now only too evident; he wished to bring her broadside\
  \ to bear on the Chimneys and from there to reply with shell and ball to the shot\
  \ which had till then decimated her crew.</p>"
- "<p>Soon the \u201CSpeedy\u201D reached the point of the islet; she rounded it with\
  \ ease; the mainsail was braced up, and the brig hugging the wind, stood across\
  \ the mouth of the Mercy.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe scoundrels! they are coming!\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>At that moment, Cyrus Harding, Ayrton, the sailor, and Herbert, were rejoined
  by Neb and Gideon Spilett.</p>
- <p>The reporter and his companion had judged it best to abandon the post at the
  Mercy, from which they could do nothing against the ship, and they had acted wisely.
  It was better that the colonists should be together at the moment when they were
  about to engage in a decisive action. Gideon Spilett and Neb had arrived by dodging
  behind the rocks, though not without attracting a shower of bullets, which had not,
  however, reached them.</p>
- "<p>\u201CSpilett! Neb!\u201D cried the engineer. \u201CYou are not wounded?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D answered the reporter, \u201Ca few bruises only from the ricochet!\
  \ But that cursed brig has entered the channel!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cand in ten minutes she will have anchored\
  \ before Granite House!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHave you formed any plan, Cyrus?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe must take refuge in Granite House while there is still time, and the\
  \ convicts cannot see us.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is, my opinion, too,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, \u201Cbut once\
  \ shut up?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe must be guided by circumstances,\u201D said the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us be off, then, and make haste!\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWould you not wish, captain, that Ayrton and I should remain here?\u201D\
  \ asked the sailor.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat would be the use of that, Pencroft?\u201D replied Harding. \u201C\
  No. We will not separate!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>There was not a moment to be lost. The colonists left the Chimneys. A bend of\
  \ the cliff prevented them from being seen by those in the brig, but two or three\
  \ reports, and the crash of bullets on the rock, told them that the \u201CSpeedy\u201D\
  \ was at no great distance.</p>"
- <p>To spring into the lift, hoist themselves up to the door of Granite House, where
  Top and Jup had been shut up since the evening before, to rush into the large room,
  was the work of a minute only.</p>
- "<p>It was quite time, for the settlers, through the branches, could see the \u201C\
  Speedy,\u201D surrounded with smoke, gliding up the channel. The firing was incessant,\
  \ and shot from the four guns struck blindly, both on the Mercy post, although it\
  \ was not occupied, and on the Chimneys. The rocks were splintered, and cheers accompanied\
  \ each discharge. However, they were hoping that Granite House would be spared,\
  \ thanks to Harding\u2019s precaution of concealing the windows when a shot, piercing\
  \ the door, penetrated into the passage.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe are discovered!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>The colonists had not, perhaps, been seen, but it was certain that Bob Harvey
  had thought proper to send a ball through the suspected foliage which concealed
  that part of the cliff. Soon he redoubled his attack, when another ball having torn
  away the leafy screen, disclosed a gaping aperture in the granite.</p>
- "<p>The colonists\u2019 situation was desperate. Their retreat was discovered. They\
  \ could not oppose any obstacle to these missiles, nor protect the stone, which\
  \ flew in splinters around them. There was nothing to be done but to take refuge\
  \ in the upper passage of Granite House, and leave their dwelling to be devastated,\
  \ when a deep roar was heard, followed by frightful cries!</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions rushed to one of the windows?</p>
- "<p>The brig, irresistibly raised on a sort of water\u2011spout, had just split\
  \ in two, and in less than ten seconds she was swallowed up with all her criminal\
  \ crew!</p>"
- <p>Chapter 4</p>
- "<p>\u201CShe has blown up!\u201D cried Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes! blown up, just as if Ayrton had set fire to the powder!\u201D returned\
  \ Pencroft, throwing himself into the lift together with Neb and the lad.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut what has happened?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett, quite stunned by this\
  \ unexpected catastrophe.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh! this time, we shall know?\u201D answered the engineer quickly.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat shall we know??\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLater! later! Come, Spilett. The main point is that these pirates have\
  \ been exterminated!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And Cyrus Harding, hurrying away the reporter and Ayrton, joined Pencroft, Neb,
  and Herbert on the beach.</p>
- "<p>Nothing could be seen of the brig, not even her masts. After having been raised\
  \ by the water\u2011spout, she had fallen on her side, and had sunk in that position,\
  \ doubtless in consequence of some enormous leak. But as in that place the channel\
  \ was not more than twenty feet in depth, it was certain that the sides of the submerged\
  \ brig would reappear at low water.</p>"
- "<p>A few things from the wreck floated on the surface of the water, a raft could\
  \ be seen consisting of spare spars, coops of poultry with their occupants still\
  \ living, boxes and barrels, which gradually came to the surface, after having escaped\
  \ through the hatchways, but no pieces of the wreck appeared, neither planks from\
  \ the deck, nor timber from the hull,?which rendered the sudden disappearance of\
  \ the \u201CSpeedy\u201D perfectly inexplicable.</p>"
- <p>However, the two masts, which had been broken and escaped from the shrouds and
  stays came up, and with their sails, some furled and the others spread. But it was
  not necessary to wait for the tide to bring up these riches, and Ayrton and Pencroft
  jumped into the boat with the intention of towing the pieces of wreck either to
  the beach or to the islet. But just as they were shoving off, an observation from
  Gideon Spilett arrested them.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat about those six convicts who disembarked on the right bank of the\
  \ Mercy?\u201D said he.</p>"
- <p>In fact, it would not do to forget that the six men whose boat had gone to pieces
  on the rocks had landed at Flotsam Point.</p>
- <p>They looked in that direction. None of the fugitives were visible. It was probable
  that, having seen their vessel engulfed in the channel, they had fled into the interior
  of the island.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe will deal with them later,\u201D said Harding. \u201CAs they are armed,\
  \ they will still be dangerous; but as it is six against six, the chances are equal.\
  \ To the most pressing business first.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Ayrton and Pencroft pulled vigorously towards the wreck.</p>
- <p>The sea was calm and the tide very high, as there had been a new moon but two
  days before. A whole hour at least would elapse before the hull of the brig could
  emerge from the water of the channel.</p>
- <p>Ayrton and Pencroft were able to fasten the masts and spars by means of ropes,
  the ends of which were carried to the beach. There, by the united efforts of the
  settlers the pieces of wreck were hauled up. Then the boat picked up all that was
  floating, coops, barrels, and boxes, which were immediately carried to the Chimneys.</p>
- <p>Several bodies floated also. Among them, Ayrton recognized that of Bob Harvey,
  which he pointed out to his companion, saying with some emotion,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CThat is what I have been, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut what you are no longer, brave Ayrton!\u201D returned the sailor warmly.</p>"
- <p>It was singular enough that so few bodies floated. Only five or six were counted,
  which were already being carried by the current towards the open sea. Very probably
  the convicts had not had time to escape, and the ship lying over on her side, the
  greater number of them had remained below. Now the current, by carrying the bodies
  of these miserable men out to sea, would spare the colonists the sad task of burying
  them in some corner of their island.</p>
- <p>For two hours, Cyrus Harding and his companions were solely occupied in hauling
  up the spars on to the sand, and then in spreading the sails which were perfectly
  uninjured, to dry. They spoke little, for they were absorbed in their work, but
  what thoughts occupied their minds!</p>
- <p>The possession of this brig, or rather all that she contained, was a perfect
  mine of wealth. In fact, a ship is like a little world in miniature, and the stores
  of the colony would be increased by a large number of useful articles. It would
  be, on a large scale, equivalent to the chest found at Flotsam Point.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAnd besides,\u201D thought Pencroft, \u201Cwhy should it be impossible\
  \ to refloat the brig? If she has only a leak, that may be stopped up; a vessel\
  \ from three to four hundred tons, why she is a regular ship compared to our ?Bonadventure\u2019\
  ! And we could go a long distance in her! We could go anywhere we liked! Captain\
  \ Harding, Ayrton and I must examine her! She would be well worth the trouble!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>In fact, if the brig was still fit to navigate, the colonists\u2019 chances\
  \ of returning to their native land were singularly increased. But, to decide this\
  \ important question, it was necessary to wait until the tide was quite low, so\
  \ that every part of the brig\u2019s hull might be examined.</p>"
- <p>When their treasures had been safely conveyed on shore, Harding and his companions
  agreed to devote some minutes to breakfast. They were almost famished; fortunately,
  the larder was not far off, and Neb was noted for being an expeditious cook. They
  breakfasted, therefore, near the Chimneys, and during their repast, as may be supposed,
  nothing was talked of but the event which had so miraculously saved the colony.</p>
- "<p>\u201CMiraculous is the word,\u201D repeated Pencroft, \u201Cfor it must be\
  \ acknowledged that those rascals blew up just at the right moment! Granite House\
  \ was beginning to be uncomfortable as a habitation!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd can you guess, Pencroft,\u201D asked the reporter, \u201Chow it happened,\
  \ or what can have occasioned the explosion?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh! Mr. Spilett, nothing is more simple,\u201D answered Pencroft. \u201C\
  A convict vessel is not disciplined like a man\u2011of\u2011war! Convicts are not\
  \ sailors. Of course the powder\u2011magazine was open, and as they were firing\
  \ incessantly, some careless or clumsy fellow just blew up the vessel!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Harding,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cwhat astonishes me is that\
  \ the explosion has not produced more effect. The report was not loud, and besides\
  \ there are so few planks and timbers torn out. It seems as if the ship had rather\
  \ foundered than blown up.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDoes that astonish you, my boy?\u201D asked the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, captain.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd it astonishes me also, Herbert,\u201D replied he, \u201Cbut when we\
  \ visit the hull of the brig, we shall no doubt find the explanation of the matter.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy, captain,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cyou don\u2019t suppose that the\
  \ ?Speedy\u2019 simply foundered like a ship which has struck on a rock?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy not,\u201D observed Neb, \u201Cif there are rocks in the channel?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNonsense, Neb,\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201Cyou did not look at the\
  \ right moment. An instant before she sank, the brig, as I saw perfectly well, rose\
  \ on an enormous wave, and fell back on her larboard side. Now, if she had only\
  \ struck, she would have sunk quietly and gone to the bottom like an honest vessel.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt was just because she was not an honest vessel!\u201D returned Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, we shall soon see, Pencroft,\u201D said the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall soon see,\u201D rejoined the sailor, \u201Cbut I would wager\
  \ my head there are no rocks in the channel. Look here, captain, to speak candidly,\
  \ do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the occurrence?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding did not answer.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAt any rate,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cwhether rock or explosion,\
  \ you will agree, Pencroft, that it occurred just in the nick of time!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes! yes!\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cbut that is not the question.\
  \ I ask Captain Harding if he sees anything supernatural in all this.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI cannot say, Pencroft,\u201D said the engineer. \u201CThat is all the\
  \ answer I can make.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>A reply which did not satisfy Pencroft at all. He stuck to \u201Can explosion,\u201D\
  \ and did not wish to give it up. He would never consent to admit that in that channel,\
  \ with its fine sandy bed, just like the beach, which he had often crossed at low\
  \ water, there could be an unknown rock.</p>"
- <p>And besides, at the time the brig foundered, it was high water, that is to say,
  there was enough water to carry the vessel clear over any rocks which would not
  be uncovered at low tide. Therefore, there could not have been a collision. Therefore,
  the vessel had not struck. So she had blown up.</p>
- "<p>And it must be confessed that the sailor\u2019s arguments were reasonable.</p>"
- "<p>Towards half\u2011past one, the colonists embarked in the boat to visit the\
  \ wreck. It was to be regretted that the brig\u2019s two boats had not been saved;\
  \ but one, as has been said, had gone to pieces at the mouth of the Mercy, and was\
  \ absolutely useless; the other had disappeared when the brig went down, and had\
  \ not again been seen, having doubtless been crushed.</p>"
- "<p>The hull of the \u201CSpeedy\u201D was just beginning to issue from the water.\
  \ The brig was lying right over on her side, for her masts being broken, pressed\
  \ down by the weight of the ballast displaced by the shock, the keel was visible\
  \ along her whole length. She had been regularly turned over by the inexplicable\
  \ but frightful submarine action, which had been at the same time manifested by\
  \ an enormous water\u2011spout.</p>"
- <p>The settlers rowed round the hull, and in proportion as the tide went down, they
  could ascertain, if not the cause which had occasioned the catastrophe, at least
  the effect produced.</p>
- <p>Towards the bows, on both sides of the keel, seven or eight feet from the beginning
  of the stem, the sides of the brig were frightfully torn. Over a length of at least
  twenty feet there opened two large leaks, which would be impossible to stop up.
  Not only had the copper sheathing and the planks disappeared, reduced, no doubt,
  to powder, but also the ribs, the iron bolts, and treenails which united them. From
  the entire length of the hull to the stern the false keel had been separated with
  an unaccountable violence, and the keel itself, torn from the carline in several
  places, was split in all its length.</p>
- "<p>\u201CI\u2019ve a notion!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201Cthat this vessel will\
  \ be difficult to get afloat again.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt will be impossible,\u201D said Ayrton.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt any rate,\u201D observed Gideon Spilett to the sailor, \u201Cthe explosion,\
  \ if there has been one, has produced singular effects! It has split the lower part\
  \ of the hull, instead of blowing up the deck and topsides! These great rents appear\
  \ rather to have been made by a rock than by the explosion of a powder\u2011magazine.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThere is not a rock in the channel!\u201D answered the sailor. \u201C\
  I will admit anything you like, except the rock.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us try to penetrate into the interior of the brig,\u201D said the\
  \ engineer; \u201Cperhaps we shall then know what to think of the cause of her destruction.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>This was the best thing to be done, and it was agreed, besides, to take an inventory
  of all the treasures on board, and to arrange their preservation.</p>
- <p>Access to the interior of the brig was now easy. The tide was still going down
  and the deck was practicable. The ballast, composed of heavy masses of iron, had
  broken through in several places. The noise of the sea could be heard as it rushed
  out at the holes in the hull.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions, hatchets in hand, advanced along the shattered
  deck. Cases of all sorts encumbered it, and, as they had been but a very short time
  in the water, their contents were perhaps uninjured.</p>
- <p>They then busied themselves in placing all this cargo in safety. The water would
  not return for several hours, and these hours must be employed in the most profitable
  way. Ayrton and Pencroft had, at the entrance made in the hull, discovered tackle,
  which would serve to hoist up the barrels and chests. The boat received them and
  transported them to the shore. They took the articles as they came, intending to
  sort them afterwards.</p>
- "<p>At any rate, the settlers saw at once, with extreme satisfaction, that the brig\
  \ possessed a very varied cargo?an assortment of all sorts of articles, utensils,\
  \ manufactured goods, and tools?such as the ships which make the great coasting\u2011\
  trade of Polynesia are usually laden with. It was probable that they would find\
  \ a little of everything, and they agreed that it was exactly what was necessary\
  \ for the colony of Lincoln Island.</p>"
- <p>However?and Cyrus Harding observed it in silent astonishment?not only, as has
  been said, had the hull of the brig enormously suffered from the shock, whatever
  it was, that had occasioned the catastrophe, but the interior arrangements had been
  destroyed, especially towards the bows. Partitions and stanchions were smashed,
  as if some tremendous shell had burst in the interior of the brig. The colonists
  could easily go fore and aft, after having removed the cases as they were extricated.
  They were not heavy bales, which would have been difficult to remove, but simple
  packages, of which the stowage, besides, was no longer recognizable.</p>
- "<p>The colonists then reached the stern of the brig?the part formerly surmounted\
  \ by the poop. It was there that, following Ayrton\u2019s directions, they must\
  \ look for the powder\u2011magazine. Cyrus Harding thought that it had not exploded;\
  \ that it was possible some barrels might be saved, and that the powder, which is\
  \ usually enclosed in metal coverings might not have suffered from contact with\
  \ the water.</p>"
- "<p>This, in fact, was just what had happened. They extricated from among a large\
  \ number of shot twenty barrels, the insides of which were lined with copper. Pencroft\
  \ was convinced by the evidence of his own eyes that the destruction of the \u201C\
  Speedy\u201D could not be attributed to an explosion. That part of the hull in which\
  \ the magazine was situated was, moreover, that which had suffered least.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt may be so,\u201D said the obstinate sailor; \u201Cbut as to a rock,\
  \ there is not one in the channel!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen, how did it happen?\u201D asked Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201CCaptain Harding doesn\u2019\
  t know, and nobody knows or ever will know!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Several hours had passed during these researches, and the tide began to flow.
  Work must be suspended for the present. There was no fear of the brig being carried
  away by the sea, for she was already fixed as firmly as if moored by her anchors.</p>
- <p>They could, therefore, without inconvenience, wait until the next day to resume
  operations; but, as to the vessel itself, she was doomed, and it would be best to
  hasten to save the remains of her hull, as she would not be long in disappearing
  in the quicksands of the channel.</p>
- "<p>It was now five o\u2019clock in the evening. It had been a hard day\u2019s work\
  \ for the men. They ate with good appetite, and notwithstanding their fatigue, they\
  \ could not resist, after dinner, their desire of inspecting the cases which composed\
  \ the cargo of the \u201CSpeedy.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Most of them contained clothes, which, as may be believed, was well received.\
  \ There were enough to clothe a whole colony?linen for every one\u2019s use, shoes\
  \ for every one\u2019s feet.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe are too rich!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201CBut what are we going\
  \ to do with all this?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>And every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor when he caught\
  \ sight of the barrels of gunpowder, firearms and sidearms, balls of cotton, implements\
  \ of husbandry, carpenter\u2019s, joiner\u2019s, and blacksmith\u2019s tools, and\
  \ boxes of all kinds of seeds, not in the least injured by their short sojourn in\
  \ the water. Ah, two years before, how these things would have been prized! And\
  \ now, even though the industrious colonists had provided themselves with tools,\
  \ these treasures would find their use.</p>"
- "<p>There was no want of space in the store\u2011rooms of Granite House, but that\
  \ daytime would not allow them to stow away the whole. It would not do also to forget\
  \ that the six survivors of the \u201CSpeedy\u2019s\u201D crew had landed on the\
  \ island, for they were in all probability scoundrels of the deepest dye, and it\
  \ was necessary that the colonists should be on their guard against them. Although\
  \ the bridges over the Mercy were raised, the convicts would not be stopped by a\
  \ river or a stream and, rendered desperate, these wretches would be capable of\
  \ anything.</p>"
- <p>They would see later what plan it would be best to follow; but in the meantime
  it was necessary to mount guard over cases and packages heaped up near the Chimneys,
  and thus the settlers employed themselves in turn during the night.</p>
- <p>The morning came, however, without the convicts having attempted any attack.
  Master Jup and Top, on guard at the foot of Granite House, would have quickly given
  the alarm. The three following days?the 19th, 20th, and 21st of October?were employed
  in saving everything of value, or of any use whatever, either from the cargo or
  rigging of the brig. At low tide they overhauled the hold?at high tide they stowed
  away the rescued articles. A great part of the copper sheathing had been torn from
  the hull, which every day sank lower. But before the sand had swallowed the heavy
  things which had fallen through the bottom, Ayrton and Pencroft, diving to the bed
  of the channel, recovered the chains and anchors of the brig, the iron of her ballast,
  and even four guns, which, floated by means of empty casks, were brought to shore.</p>
- "<p>It may be seen that the arsenal of the colony had gained by the wreck, as well\
  \ as the storerooms of Granite House. Pencroft, always enthusiastic in his projects,\
  \ already spoke of constructing a battery to command the channel and the mouth of\
  \ the river. With four guns, he engaged to prevent any fleet, \u201Chowever powerful\
  \ it might be,\u201D from venturing into the waters of Lincoln Island!</p>"
- <p>In the meantime, when nothing remained of the brig but a useless hulk, bad weather
  came on, which soon finished her. Cyrus Harding had intended to blow her up, so
  as to collect the remains on the shore, but a strong gale from the northeast and
  a heavy sea compelled him to economize his powder.</p>
- <p>In fact, on the night of the 23rd, the hull entirely broke up, and some of the
  wreck was cast up on the beach.</p>
- "<p>As to the papers on board, it is useless to say that, although he carefully\
  \ searched the lockers of the poop, Harding did not discover any trace of them.\
  \ The pirates had evidently destroyed everything that concerned either the captain\
  \ or the owners of the \u201CSpeedy,\u201D and, as the name of her port was not\
  \ painted on her counter, there was nothing which would tell them her nationality.\
  \ However, by the shape of her boats Ayrton and Pencroft believed that the brig\
  \ was of English build.</p>"
- <p>A week after the castrophe?or, rather, after the fortunate, though inexplicable,
  event to which the colony owed its preservation?nothing more could be seen of the
  vessel, even at low tide. The wreck had disappeared, and Granite House was enriched
  by nearly all it had contained.</p>
- <p>However, the mystery which enveloped its strange destruction would doubtless
  never have been cleared away if, on the 30th of November, Neb, strolling on the
  beach, had not found a piece of a thick iron cylinder, bearing traces of explosion.
  The edges of this cylinder were twisted and broken, as if they had been subjected
  to the action of some explosive substance.</p>
- <p>Neb brought this piece of metal to his master, who was then occupied with his
  companions in the workshop of the Chimneys.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding examined the cylinder attentively, then, turning to Pencroft,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CYou persist, my friend,\u201D said he, \u201Cin maintaining that the ?Speedy\u2019\
  \ was not lost in consequence of a collision?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, captain,\u201D answered the sailor. \u201CYou know as well as I do\
  \ that there are no rocks in the channel.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut suppose she had run against this piece of iron?\u201D said the engineer,\
  \ showing the broken cylinder.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat, that bit of pipe!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft in a tone of perfect\
  \ incredulity.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy friends,\u201D resumed Harding, \u201Cyou remember that before she\
  \ foundered the brig rose on the summit of a regular waterspout?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, captain,\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, would you like to know what occasioned that waterspout? It was this,\u201D\
  \ said the engineer, holding up the broken tube.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat?\u201D returned Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes! This cylinder is all that remains of a torpedo!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA torpedo!\u201D exclaimed the engineer\u2019s companions.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd who put the torpedo there?\u201D demanded Pencroft, who did not like\
  \ to yield.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAll that I can tell you is, that it was not I,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding;\
  \ \u201Cbut it was there, and you have been able to judge of its incomparable power!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Chapter 5</p>
- "<p>So, then, all was explained by the submarine explosion of this torpedo. Cyrus\
  \ Harding could not be mistaken, as, during the war of the Union, he had had occasion\
  \ to try these terrible engines of destruction. It was under the action of this\
  \ cylinder, charged with some explosive substance, nitro\u2011glycerine, picrate,\
  \ or some other material of the same nature, that the water of the channel had been\
  \ raised like a dome, the bottom of the brig crushed in, and she had sunk instantly,\
  \ the damage done to her hull being so considerable that it was impossible to refloat\
  \ her. The \u201CSpeedy\u201D had not been able to withstand a torpedo that would\
  \ have destroyed an ironclad as easily as a fishing\u2011boat!</p>"
- <p>Yes! all was explained, everything?except the presence of the torpedo in the
  waters of the channel!</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friends, then,\u201D said Cyrus Harding, \u201Cwe can no longer be\
  \ in doubt as to the presence of a mysterious being, a castaway like us, perhaps,\
  \ abandoned on our island, and I say this in order that Ayrton may be acquainted\
  \ with all the strange events which have occurred during these two years. Who this\
  \ beneficent stranger is, whose intervention has, so fortunately for us, been manifested\
  \ on many occasions, I cannot imagine. What his object can be in acting thus, in\
  \ concealing himself after rendering us so many services, I cannot understand: But\
  \ his services are not the less real, and are of such a nature that only a man possessed\
  \ of prodigious power, could render them. Ayrton is indebted to him as much as we\
  \ are, for, if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after the fall from\
  \ the balloon, evidently it was he who wrote the document, who placed the bottle\
  \ in the channel, and who has made known to us the situation of our companion. I\
  \ will add that it was he who guided that chest, provided with everything we wanted,\
  \ and stranded it on Flotsam Point; that it was he who lighted that fire on the\
  \ heights of the island, which permitted you to land; that it was he who fired that\
  \ bullet found in the body of the peccary; that it was he who plunged that torpedo\
  \ into the channel, which destroyed the brig; in a word, that all those inexplicable\
  \ events, for which we could not assign a reason, are due to this mysterious being.\
  \ Therefore, whoever he may be, whether shipwrecked, or exiled on our island, we\
  \ shall be ungrateful, if we think ourselves freed from gratitude towards him. We\
  \ have contracted a debt, and I hope that we shall one day pay it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are right in speaking thus, my dear Cyrus,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett.\
  \ \u201CYes, there is an almost all\u2011powerful being, hidden in some part of\
  \ the island, and whose influence has been singularly useful to our colony. I will\
  \ add that the unknown appears to possess means of action which border on the supernatural,\
  \ if in the events of practical life the supernatural were recognizable. Is it he\
  \ who is in secret communication with us by the well in Granite House, and has he\
  \ thus a knowledge of all our plans? Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the\
  \ vessel made her first cruise? Was it he who threw Top out of the lake, and killed\
  \ the dugong? Was it he, who as everything leads us to believe, saved you from the\
  \ waves, and that under circumstances in which any one else would not have been\
  \ able to act? If it was he, he possesses a power which renders him master of the\
  \ elements.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The reporter\u2019s reasoning was just, and every one felt it to be so.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D rejoined Cyrus Harding, \u201Cif the intervention of a human\
  \ being is not more questionable for us, I agree that he has at his disposal means\
  \ of action beyond those possessed by humanity. There is a mystery still, but if\
  \ we discover the man, the mystery will be discovered also. The question, then,\
  \ is, ought we to respect the incognito of this generous being, or ought we to do\
  \ everything to find him out? What is your opinion on the matter?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy opinion,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cis that, whoever he may be, he\
  \ is a brave man, and he has my esteem!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBe it so,\u201D answered Harding, \u201Cbut that is not an answer, Pencroft.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CMaster,\u201D then said Neb, \u201Cmy idea is, that we may search as long\
  \ as we like for this gentleman whom you are talking about, but that we shall not\
  \ discover him till he pleases.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat\u2019s not bad, what you say, Neb,\u201D observed Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am of Neb\u2019s opinion,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cbut that\
  \ is no reason for not attempting the adventure. Whether we find this mysterious\
  \ being or not, we shall at least have fulfilled our duty towards him.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd you, my boy, give us your opinion,\u201D said the engineer, turning\
  \ to Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh,\u201D cried Herbert, his countenance full of animation, \u201Chow\
  \ I should like to thank him, he who saved you first, and who has now saved us!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201COf course, my boy,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cso would I and all of\
  \ us. I am not inquisitive, but I would give one of my eyes to see this individual\
  \ face to face! It seems to me that he must be handsome, tall, strong, with a splendid\
  \ beard, radiant hair, and that he must be seated on clouds, a great ball in his\
  \ hands!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, Pencroft,\u201D answered Spilett, \u201Cyou are describing a picture\
  \ of the Creator.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPossibly, Mr. Spilett,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cbut that is how\
  \ I imagine him!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd you, Ayrton?\u201D asked the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Harding,\u201D replied Ayrton, \u201CI can give you no better\
  \ advice in this matter. Whatever you do will be best; when you wish me to join\
  \ you in your researches, I am ready to follow you.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI thank you, Ayrton,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding, \u201Cbut I should\
  \ like a more direct answer to the question I put to you. You are our companion;\
  \ you have already endangered your life several times for us, and you, as well as\
  \ the rest, ought to be consulted in the matter of any important decision. Speak,\
  \ therefore.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Harding,\u201D replied Ayrton, \u201CI think that we ought to\
  \ do everything to discover this unknown benefactor. Perhaps he is alone. Perhaps\
  \ he is suffering. Perhaps he has a life to be renewed. I, too, as you said, have\
  \ a debt of gratitude to pay him. It was he, it could be only he who must have come\
  \ to Tabor Island, who found there the wretch you knew, and who made known to you\
  \ that there was an unfortunate man there to be saved. Therefore it is, thanks to\
  \ him, that I have become a man again. No, I will never forget him!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is settled, then,\u201D said Cyrus Harding. \u201CWe will begin our\
  \ researches as soon as possible. We will not leave a corner of the island unexplored.\
  \ We will search into its most secret recesses, and will hope that our unknown friend\
  \ will pardon us in consideration of our intentions!\u201D</p>"
- <p>For several days the colonists were actively employed in haymaking and the harvest.
  Before putting their project of exploring the yet unknown parts of the island into
  execution, they wished to get all possible work finished. It was also the time for
  collecting the various vegetables from the Tabor Island plants. All was stowed away,
  and happily there was no want of room in Granite House, in which they might have
  housed all the treasures of the island. The products of the colony were there, methodically
  arranged, and in a safe place, as may be believed, sheltered as much from animals
  as from man.</p>
- "<p>There was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite. Many\
  \ natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged either by pick\u2011\
  axe or mine, and Granite House thus became a general warehouse, containing all the\
  \ provisions, arms, tools, and spare utensils?in a word, all the stores of the colony.</p>"
- "<p>As to the guns obtained from the brig, they were pretty pieces of ordnance,\
  \ which, at Pencroft\u2019s entreaty, were hoisted by means of tackle and pulleys,\
  \ right up into Granite House; embrasures were made between the windows, and the\
  \ shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen through the granite cliff. From\
  \ this height they commanded all Union Bay. It was like a little Gibraltar, and\
  \ any vessel anchored off the islet would inevitably be exposed to the fire of this\
  \ aerial battery.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain,\u201D said Pencroft one day, it was the 8th of November, \u201C\
  now that our fortifications are finished, it would be a good thing if we tried the\
  \ range of our guns.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDo you think that is useful?\u201D asked the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is more than useful, it is necessary! Without that how are we to know\
  \ to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we are provided?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CTry them, Pencroft,\u201D replied the engineer. \u201CHowever, I think\
  \ that in making the experiment, we ought to employ, not the ordinary powder, the\
  \ supply of which, I think, should remain untouched, but the pyroxyle which will\
  \ never fail us.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCan the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?\u201D asked the reporter,\
  \ who was not less anxious than Pencroft to try the artillery of Granite House.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI believe so. However,\u201D added the engineer, \u201Cwe will be prudent.\u201D\
  \ The engineer was right in thinking that the guns were of excellent make. Made\
  \ of forged steel, and breech\u2011loaders, they ought consequently to be able to\
  \ bear a considerable charge, and also have an enormous range. In fact, as regards\
  \ practical effect, the transit described by the ball ought to be as extended as\
  \ possible, and this tension could only be obtained under the condition that the\
  \ projectile should be impelled with a very great initial velocity.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNow,\u201D said Harding to his companions, \u201Cthe initial velocity\
  \ is in proportion to the quantity of powder used. In the fabrication of these pieces,\
  \ everything depends on employing a metal with the highest possible power of resistance,\
  \ and steel is incontestably that metal of all others which resists the best. I\
  \ have, therefore, reason to believe that our guns will bear without risk the expansion\
  \ of the pyroxyle gas, and will give excellent results.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall be a great deal more certain of that when we have tried them!\u201D\
  \ answered Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>It is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect order. Since they
  had been taken from the water, the sailor had bestowed great care upon them. How
  many hours he had spent, in rubbing, greasing, and polishing them, and in cleaning
  the mechanism! And now the pieces were as brilliant as if they had been on board
  a frigate of the United States Navy.</p>
- '<p>On this day, therefore, in presence of all the members of the colony, including
  Master Jup and Top, the four cannon were successively tried. They were charged with
  pyroxyle, taking into consideration its explosive power, which, as has been said,
  is four times that of ordinary powder: the projectile to be fired was cylindroconic.</p>'
- "<p>Pencroft, holding the end of the quick\u2011match, stood ready to fire.</p>"
- "<p>At Harding\u2019s signal, he fired. The shot, passing over the islet, fell into\
  \ the sea at a distance which could not be calculated with exactitude.</p>"
- <p>The second gun was pointed at the rocks at the end of Flotsam Point, and the
  shot striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from Granite House, made it fly into
  splinters. It was Herbert who had pointed this gun and fired it, and very proud
  he was of his first shot. Pencroft only was prouder than he! Such a shot, the honor
  of which belonged to his dear boy.</p>
- '<p>The third shot, aimed this time at the downs forming the upper side of Union
  Bay, struck the sand at a distance of four miles, then having ricocheted: was lost
  in the sea in a cloud of spray.</p>'
- <p>For the fourth piece Cyrus Harding slightly increased the charge, so as to try
  its extreme range. Then, all standing aside for fear of its bursting, the match
  was lighted by means of a long cord.</p>
- <p>A tremendous report was heard, but the piece had held good, and the colonists
  rushing to the windows, saw the shot graze the rocks of Mandible Cape, nearly five
  miles from Granite House, and disappear in Shark Gulf.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, captain,\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, whose cheers might have rivaled\
  \ the reports themselves, \u201Cwhat do you say of our battery? All the pirates\
  \ in the Pacific have only to present themselves before Granite House! Not one can\
  \ land there now without our permission!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBelieve me, Pencroft,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cit would be better\
  \ not to have to make the experiment.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cwhat ought to be done with regard to\
  \ those six villains who are roaming about the island? Are we to leave them to overrun\
  \ our forests, our fields, our plantations? These pirates are regular jaguars, and\
  \ it seems to me we ought not to hesitate to treat them as such! What do you think,\
  \ Ayrton?\u201D added Pencroft, turning to his companion.</p>"
- <p>Ayrton hesitated at first to reply, and Cyrus Harding regretted that Pencroft
  had so thoughtlessly put this question. And he was much moved when Ayrton replied
  in a humble tone,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CI have been one of those jaguars, Mr. Pencroft. I have no right to speak.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>And with a slow step he walked away.</p>
- <p>Pencroft understood.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat a brute I am!\u201D he exclaimed. \u201CPoor Ayrton! He has as much\
  \ right to speak here as any one!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cbut his reserve does him honor,\
  \ and it is right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CCertainly, Mr. Spilett,\u201D answered the sailor, \u201Cand there is\
  \ no fear of my doing so again. I would rather bite my tongue off than cause Ayrton\
  \ any pain! But to return to the question. It seems to me that these ruffians have\
  \ no right to any pity, and that we ought to rid the island of them as soon as possible.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIs that your opinion, Pencroft?\u201D asked the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CQuite my opinion.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until they had\
  \ committed some fresh act of hostility against us?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIsn\u2019t what they have done already enough?\u201D asked Pencroft, who\
  \ did not understand these scruples.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey may adopt other sentiments!\u201D said Harding, \u201Cand perhaps\
  \ repent.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey repent!\u201D exclaimed the sailor, shrugging his shoulders.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPencroft, think of Ayrton!\u201D said Herbert, taking the sailor\u2019\
  s hand. \u201CHe became an honest man again!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft looked at his companions one after the other. He had never thought\
  \ of his proposal being met with any objection. His rough nature could not allow\
  \ that they ought to come to terms with the rascals who had landed on the island\
  \ with Bob Harvey\u2019s accomplices, the murderers of the crew of the \u201CSpeedy,\u201D\
  \ and he looked upon them as wild beasts which ought to be destroyed without delay\
  \ and without remorse.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCome!\u201D said be. \u201CEverybody is against me! You wish to be generous\
  \ to those villains! Very well; I hope we mayn\u2019t repent it!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat danger shall we run,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cif we take care to\
  \ be always on our guard?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHum!\u201D observed the reporter, who had not given any decided opinion.\
  \ \u201CThey are six and well armed. If they each lay hid in a corner, and each\
  \ fired at one of us, they would soon be masters of the colony!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy have they not done so?\u201D said Herbert. \u201CNo doubt because\
  \ it was not their interest to do it. Besides, we are six also.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, well!\u201D replied Pencroft, whom no reasoning could have convinced.\
  \ \u201CLet us leave these good people to do what they like, and don\u2019t think\
  \ anything more about them!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCome, Pencroft,\u201D said Neb, \u201Cdon\u2019t make yourself out so\
  \ bad as all that! Suppose one of these unfortunate men were here before you, within\
  \ good range of your guns, you would not fire.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI would fire on him as I would on a mad dog, Neb,\u201D replied Pencroft\
  \ coldly.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPencroft,\u201D said the engineer, \u201Cyou have always shown much deference\
  \ to my advice; will you, in this matter, yield to me?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI will do as you please, Captain Harding,\u201D answered the sailor, who\
  \ was not at all convinced.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery well, wait, and we will not attack them unless we are attacked first.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>Thus their behavior towards the pirates was agreed upon, although Pencroft augured\
  \ nothing good from it. They were not to attack them, but were to be on their guard.\
  \ After all, the island was large and fertile. If any sentiment of honesty yet remained\
  \ in the bottom of their hearts, these wretches might perhaps be reclaimed. Was\
  \ it not their interest in the situation in which they found themselves to begin\
  \ a new life? At any rate, for humanity\u2019s sake alone, it would be right to\
  \ wait. The colonists would no longer as before, be able to go and come without\
  \ fear. Hitherto they had only wild beasts to guard against, and now six convicts\
  \ of the worst description, perhaps, were roaming over their island. It was serious,\
  \ certainly, and to less brave men, it would have been security lost! No matter!\
  \ At present, the colonists had reason on their side against Pencroft. Would they\
  \ be right in the future? That remained to be seen.</p>"
- <p>Chapter 6</p>
- "<p>However, the chief business of the colonists was to make that complete exploration\
  \ of the island which had been decided upon, and which would have two objects: to\
  \ discover the mysterious being whose existence was now indisputable, and at the\
  \ same time to find out what had become of the pirates, what retreat they had chosen,\
  \ what sort of life they were leading, and what was to be feared from them. Cyrus\
  \ Harding wished to set out without delay; but as the expedition would be of some\
  \ days duration, it appeared best to load the cart with different materials and\
  \ tools in order to facilitate the organization of the encampments. One of the onagers,\
  \ however, having hurt its leg, could not be harnessed at present, and a few days\u2019\
  \ rest was necessary. The departure was, therefore, put off for a week, until the\
  \ 20th of November. The month of November in this latitude corresponds to the month\
  \ of May in the northern zones. It was, therefore, the fine season. The sun was\
  \ entering the tropic of Capricorn, and gave the longest days in the year. The time\
  \ was, therefore, very favorable for the projected expedition, which, if it did\
  \ not accomplish its principal object, would at any rate be fruitful in discoveries,\
  \ especially of natural productions, since Harding proposed to explore those dense\
  \ forests of the Far West, which stretched to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula.</p>"
- <p>During the nine days which preceded their departure, it was agreed that the work
  on Prospect Heights should be finished off.</p>
- <p>Moreover, it was necessary for Ayrton to return to the corral, where the domesticated
  animals required his care. It was decided that he should spend two days there, and
  return to Granite House after having liberally supplied the stables.</p>
- <p>As he was about to start, Harding asked him if he would not like one of them
  to accompany him, observing that the island was less safe than formerly. Ayrton
  replied that this was unnecessary, as he was enough for the work, and that besides
  he apprehended no danger. If anything occurred at the corral, or in the neighborhood,
  he could instantly warn the colonists by sending a telegram to Granite House.</p>
- <p>Ayrton departed at dawn on the 9th, taking the cart drawn by one onager, and
  two hours after, the electric wire announced that he had found all in order at the
  corral.</p>
- <p>During these two days Harding busied himself in executing a project which would
  completely guard Granite House against any surprise. It was necessary to completely
  conceal the opening of the old outlet, which was already walled up and partly hidden
  under grass and plants, at the southern angle of Lake Grant. Nothing was easier,
  since if the level of the lake was raised two or three feet, the opening would be
  quite beneath it. Now, to raise this level they had only to establish a dam at the
  two openings made by the lake, and by which were fed Creek Glycerine and Falls River.</p>
- "<p>The colonists worked with a will, and the two dams which besides did not exceed\
  \ eight feet in width by three in height, were rapidly erected by means of well\u2011\
  cemented blocks of stone.</p>"
- <p>This work finished, it would have been impossible to guess that at that part
  of the lake, there existed a subterranean passage through which the overflow of
  the lake formerly escaped.</p>
- <p>Of course the little stream which fed the reservoir of Granite House and worked
  the lift, had been carefully preserved, and the water could not fail. The lift once
  raised, this sure and comfortable retreat would be safe from any surprise.</p>
- "<p>This work had been so quickly done, that Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert\
  \ found time to make an expedition to Port Balloon, The sailor was very anxious\
  \ to know if the little creek in which the \u201CBonadventure\u201D was moored,\
  \ had been visited by the convicts.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThese gentlemen,\u201D he observed, \u201Clanded on the south coast, and\
  \ if they followed the shore, it is to be feared that they may have discovered the\
  \ little harbor, and in that case, I wouldn\u2019t give half\u2011a\u2011dollar\
  \ for our ?Bonadventure.\u201C</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft\u2019s apprehensions were not without foundation, and a visit to Port\
  \ Balloon appeared to be very desirable. The sailor and his companions set off on\
  \ the 10th of November, after dinner, well armed. Pencroft, ostentatiously slipping\
  \ two bullets into each barrel of his rifle, shook his head in a way which betokened\
  \ nothing good to any one who approached too near him, whether \u201Cman or beast,\u201D\
  \ as he said. Gideon Spilett and Herbert also took their guns, and about three o\u2019\
  clock all three left Granite House.</p>"
- "<p>Neb accompanied them to the turn of the Mercy, and after they had crossed, he\
  \ raised the bridge. It was agreed that a gunshot should announce the colonists\u2019\
  \ return, and that at the signal Neb should return and reestablish the communication\
  \ between the two banks of the river.</p>"
- <p>The little band advanced directly along the road which led to the southern coast
  of the island. This was only a distance of three miles and a half, but Gideon Spilett
  and his companions took two hours to traverse it. They examined all the border of
  the road, the thick forest, as well as Tabor Marsh. They found no trace of the fugitives
  who, no doubt, not having yet discovered the number of the colonists, or the means
  of defense which they had at their disposal, had gained the less accessible parts
  of the island.</p>
- "<p>Arrived at Port Balloon, Pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction that the \u201C\
  Bonadventure\u201D was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek. However, Port Balloon\
  \ was so well hidden among high rocks, that it could scarcely be discovered either\
  \ from the land or the sea.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCome,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cthe blackguards have not been there yet.\
  \ Long grass suits reptiles best, and evidently we shall find them in the Far West.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd it\u2019s very lucky, for if they had found the ?Bonadventure\u2019\
  ,\u201D added Herbert, \u201Cthey would have gone off in her, and we should have\
  \ been prevented from returning to Tabor Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIndeed,\u201D remarked the reporter, \u201Cit will be important to take\
  \ a document there which will make known the situation of Lincoln Island, and Ayrton\u2019\
  s new residence, in case the Scotch yacht returns to fetch him.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, the ?Bonadventure\u2019 is always there, Mr. Spilett,\u201D answered\
  \ the sailor. \u201CShe and her crew are ready to start at a moment\u2019s notice!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CI think, Pencroft, that that is a thing to be done after our exploration\
  \ of the island is finished. It is possible after all that the stranger, if we manage\
  \ to find him, may know as much about Tabor Island as about Lincoln Island. Do not\
  \ forget that he is certainly the author of the document, and he may, perhaps, know\
  \ how far we may count on the return of the yacht!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201Cwho in the world can he be? The fellow\
  \ knows us and we know nothing about him! If he is a simple castaway, why should\
  \ he conceal himself! We are honest men, I suppose, and the society of honest men\
  \ isn\u2019t unpleasant to any one. Did he come here voluntarily? Can he leave the\
  \ island if he likes? Is he here still? Will he remain any longer?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Chatting thus, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert got on board and looked\
  \ about the deck of the \u201CBonadventure.\u201D All at once, the sailor having\
  \ examined the bitts to which the cable of the anchor was secured,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHallo,\u201D he cried, \u201Cthis is queer!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is the matter, Pencroft?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe matter is, that it was not I who made this knot!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And Pencroft showed a rope which fastened the cable to the bitt itself.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat, it was not you?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo! I can swear to it. This is a reef knot, and I always make a running\
  \ bowline.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou must be mistaken, Pencroft.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am not mistaken!\u201D declared the sailor. \u201CMy hand does it so\
  \ naturally, and one\u2019s hand is never mistaken!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen can the convicts have been on board?\u201D asked Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI know nothing about that,\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201Cbut what is\
  \ certain, is that some one has weighed the ?Bonadventure\u2019s\u2019 anchor and\
  \ dropped it again! And look here, here is another proof! The cable of the anchor\
  \ has been run out, and its service is no longer at the hawse\u2011hole. I repeat\
  \ that some one has been using our vessel!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut if the convicts had used her, they would have pillaged her, or rather\
  \ gone off with her.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGone off! where to?to Tabor Island?\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201CDo you\
  \ think, they would risk themselves in a boat of such small tonnage?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe must, besides, be sure that they know of the islet,\u201D rejoined\
  \ the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHowever that may be,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cas sure as my name is\
  \ Bonadventure Pencroft, of the Vineyard, our ?Bonadventure\u2019 has sailed without\
  \ us!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The sailor was positive that neither Gideon Spilett nor Herbert could dispute
  his statement. It was evident that the vessel had been moved, more or less, since
  Pencroft had brought her to Port Balloon. As to the sailor, he had not the slightest
  doubt that the anchor had been raised and then dropped again. Now, what was the
  use of these two maneuvers, unless the vessel had been employed in some expedition?</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut how was it we did not see the ?Bonadventure\u2019 pass in the sight\
  \ of the island?\u201D observed the reporter, who was anxious to bring forward every\
  \ possible objection.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy, Mr. Spilett,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cthey would only have\
  \ to start in the night with a good breeze, and they would be out of sight of the\
  \ island in two hours.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D resumed Gideon Spilett, \u201CI ask again, what object could\
  \ the convicts have had in using the ?Bonadventure,\u2019 and why, after they had\
  \ made use of her, should they have brought her back to port?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhy, Mr. Spilett,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cwe must put that among\
  \ the unaccountable things, and not think anything more about it. The chief thing\
  \ is that the ?Bonadventure\u2019 was there, and she is there now. Only, unfortunately,\
  \ if the convicts take her a second time, we shall very likely not find her again\
  \ in her place!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen, Pencroft,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cwould it not be wisest to bring\
  \ the ?Bonadventure\u2019 off to Granite House?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes and no,\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201Cor rather no. The mouth of\
  \ the Mercy is a bad place for a vessel, and the sea is heavy there.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut by hauling her up on the sand, to the foot of the Chimneys?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps yes,\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201CAt any rate, since we must\
  \ leave Granite House for a long expedition, I think the ?Bonadventure\u2019 will\
  \ be safer here during our absence, and we shall do best to leave her here until\
  \ the island is rid of these blackguards.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is exactly my opinion,\u201D said the reporter. \u201CAt any rate\
  \ in the event of bad weather, she will not be exposed here as she would be at the\
  \ mouth of the Mercy.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut suppose the convicts pay her another visit,\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, my boy,\u201D replied Pencroft, \u201Cnot finding her here, they\
  \ would not be long in finding her on the sands of Granite House, and, during our\
  \ absence, nothing could hinder them from seizing her! I agree, therefore, with\
  \ Mr. Spilett, that she must be left in Port Balloon. But, if on our return we have\
  \ not rid the island of those rascals, it will be prudent to bring our boat to Granite\
  \ House, until the time when we need not fear any unpleasant visits.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat\u2019s settled. Let us be off,\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, on their return to Granite House, told\
  \ the engineer all that had passed, and the latter approved of their arrangements\
  \ both for the present and the future. He also promised the sailor that he would\
  \ study that part of the channel situated between the islet and the coast, so as\
  \ to ascertain if it would not be possible to make an artificial harbor there by\
  \ means of dams. In this way, the \u201CBonadventure\u201D would be always within\
  \ reach, under the eyes of the colonists, and if necessary, under lock and key.</p>"
- <p>That evening a telegram was sent to Ayrton, requesting him to bring from the
  corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to acclimatize to the plateau. Singularly
  enough, Ayrton did not acknowledge the receipt of the despatch, as he was accustomed
  to do. This could not but astonish the engineer. But it might be that Ayrton was
  not at that moment in the corral, or even that he was on his way back to Granite
  House. In fact, two days had already passed since his departure, and it had been
  decided that on the evening of the 10th or at the latest the morning of the 11th,
  he should return. The colonists waited, therefore, for Ayrton to appear on Prospect
  Heights. Neb and Herbert even watched at the bridge so as to be ready to lower it
  the moment their companion presented himself.</p>
- <p>But up to ten in the evening, there were no signs of Ayrton. It was, therefore,
  judged best to send a fresh despatch, requiring an immediate reply.</p>
- <p>The bell of the telegraph at Granite House remained mute.</p>
- "<p>The colonists\u2019 uneasiness was great. What had happened? Was Ayrton no longer\
  \ at the corral, or if he was still there, had he no longer control over his movements?\
  \ Could they go to the corral in this dark night?</p>"
- <p>They consulted. Some wished to go, the others to remain.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cperhaps some accident has happened to the\
  \ telegraphic apparatus, so that it works no longer?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat may be,\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWait till to\u2011morrow,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding. \u201CIt is possible,\
  \ indeed, that Ayrton has not received our despatch, or even that we have not received\
  \ his.\u201D</p>"
- <p>They waited, of course not without some anxiety.</p>
- <p>At dawn of day, the 11th of November, Harding again sent the electric current
  along the wire and received no reply.</p>
- '<p>He tried again: the same result.</p>'
- "<p>\u201COff to the corral,\u201D said he.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd well armed!\u201D added Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>It was immediately decided that Granite House should not be left alone and that
  Neb should remain there. After having accompanied his friends to Creek Glycerine,
  he raised the bridge; and waiting behind a tree he watched for the return of either
  his companions or Ayrton.</p>
- <p>In the event of the pirates presenting themselves and attempting to force the
  passage, he was to endeavor to stop them by firing on them, and as a last resource
  he was to take refuge in Granite House, where, the lift once raised, he would be
  in safety.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft were to repair to the corral,
  and if they did not find Ayrton, search the neighboring woods.</p>
- "<p>At six o\u2019clock in the morning, the engineer and his three companions had\
  \ passed Creek Glycerine, and Neb posted himself behind a small mound crowned by\
  \ several dragon trees, on the left bank of the stream.</p>"
- <p>The colonists, after leaving the plateau of Prospect Heights, immediately took
  the road to the corral. They shouldered their guns, ready to fire on the slightest
  hostile demonstration. The two rifles and the two guns had been loaded with ball.</p>
- <p>The wood was thick on each side of the road and might easily have concealed the
  convicts, who owing to their weapons would have been really formidable.</p>
- <p>The colonists walked rapidly and in silence. Top preceded them, sometimes running
  on the road, sometimes taking a ramble into the wood, but always quiet and not appearing
  to fear anything unusual. And they could be sure that the faithful dog would not
  allow them to be surprised, but would bark at the least appearance of danger.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions followed beside the road the wire which connected
  the corral with Granite House. After walking for nearly two miles, they had not
  as yet discovered any explanation of the difficulty. The posts were in good order,
  the wire regularly extended. However, at that moment the engineer observed that
  the wire appeared to be slack, and on arriving at post No. 74, Herbert, who was
  in advance stopped, exclaiming,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe wire is broken!\u201D</p>"
- <p>His companions hurried forward and arrived at the spot where the lad was standing.
  The post was rooted up and lying across the path. The unexpected explanation of
  the difficulty was here, and it was evident that the despatches from Granite House
  had not been received at the corral, nor those from the corral at Granite House.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt wasn\u2019t the wind that blew down this post,\u201D observed Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett. \u201CThe earth has been dug up round\
  \ its foot, and it has been torn up by the hand of man.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBesides, the wire is broken,\u201D added Herbert, showing that the wire\
  \ had been snapped.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIs the fracture recent?\u201D asked Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D answered Herbert, \u201Cit has certainly been done quite lately.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo the corral! to the corral!\u201D exclaimed the sailor.</p>"
- <p>The colonists were now half way between Granite House and the corral, having
  still two miles and a half to go. They pressed forward with redoubled speed.</p>
- <p>Indeed, it was to be feared that some serious accident had occurred in the corral.
  No doubt, Ayrton might have sent a telegram which had not arrived, but this was
  not the reason why his companions were so uneasy, for, a more unaccountable circumstance,
  Ayrton, who had promised to return the evening before, had not reappeared. In short,
  it was not without a motive that all communication had been stopped between the
  corral and Granite House, and who but the convicts could have any interest in interrupting
  this communication?</p>
- <p>The settlers hastened on, their hearts oppressed with anxiety. They were sincerely
  attached to their new companion. Were they to find him struck down by the hands
  of those of whom he was formerly the leader?</p>
- <p>Soon they arrived at the place where the road led along the side of the little
  stream which flowed from the Red Creek and watered the meadows of the corral. They
  then moderated their pace so that they should not be out of breath at the moment
  when a struggle might be necessary. Their guns were in their hands ready cocked.
  The forest was watched on every side. Top uttered sullen groans which were rather
  ominous.</p>
- "<p>At last the palisade appeared through the trees. No trace of any damage could\
  \ be seen. The gate was shut as usual. Deep silence reigned in the corral. Neither\
  \ the accustomed bleating of the sheep nor Ayrton\u2019s voice could be heard.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us enter,\u201D said Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>And the engineer advanced, while his companions, keeping watch about twenty\
  \ paces behind him, were ready to fire at a moment\u2019s notice.</p>"
- <p>Harding raised the inner latch of the gate and was about to push it back, when
  Top barked loudly. A report sounded and was responded to by a cry of pain.</p>
- <p>Herbert, struck by a bullet, lay stretched on the ground.</p>
- <p>Chapter 7</p>
- "<p>At Herbert\u2019s cry, Pencroft, letting his gun fall, rushed towards him.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey have killed him!\u201D he cried. \u201CMy boy! They have killed him!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ran to Herbert.</p>
- "<p>The reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad\u2019s heart was still beating.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe lives,\u201D said he, \u201Cbut he must be carried?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo Granite House? that is impossible!\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CInto the corral, then!\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn a moment,\u201D said Harding.</p>"
- "<p>And he ran round the left corner of the palisade. There he found a convict,\
  \ who aiming at him, sent a ball through his hat. In a few seconds, before he had\
  \ even time to fire his second barrel, he fell, struck to the heart by Harding\u2019\
  s dagger, more sure even than his gun.</p>"
- "<p>During this time, Gideon Spilett and the sailor hoisted themselves over the\
  \ palisade, leaped into the enclosure, threw down the props which supported the\
  \ inner door, ran into the empty house, and soon, poor Herbert was lying on Ayrton\u2019\
  s bed. In a few moments, Harding was by his side.</p>"
- "<p>On seeing Herbert senseless, the sailor\u2019s grief was terrible.</p>"
- <p>He sobbed, he cried, he tried to beat his head against the wall.</p>
- <p>Neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him. They themselves were choked
  with emotion. They could not speak.</p>
- "<p>However, they knew that it depended on them to rescue from death the poor boy\
  \ who was suffering beneath their eyes. Gideon Spilett had not passed through the\
  \ many incidents by which his life had been checkered without acquiring some slight\
  \ knowledge of medicine. He knew a little of everything, and several times he had\
  \ been obliged to attend to wounds produced either by a sword\u2011bayonet or shot.\
  \ Assisted by Cyrus Harding, he proceeded to render the aid Herbert required.</p>"
- <p>The reporter was immediately struck by the complete stupor in which Herbert lay,
  a stupor owing either to the hemorrhage, or to the shock, the ball having struck
  a bone with sufficient force to produce a violent concussion.</p>
- <p>Herbert was deadly pale, and his pulse so feeble that Spilett only felt it beat
  at long intervals, as if it was on the point of stopping.</p>
- <p>These symptoms were very serious.</p>
- "<p>Herbert\u2019s chest was laid bare, and the blood having been stanched with\
  \ handkerchiefs, it was bathed with cold water.</p>"
- <p>The contusion, or rather the contused wound appeared,?an oval below the chest
  between the third and fourth ribs. It was there that Herbert had been hit by the
  bullet.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett then turned the poor boy over; as they did so,
  he uttered a moan so feeble that they almost thought it was his last sigh.</p>
- <p>Herberts back was covered with blood from another contused wound, by which the
  ball had immediately escaped.</p>
- "<p>\u201CGod be praised!\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cthe ball is not in the\
  \ body, and we shall not have to extract it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut the heart?\u201D asked Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe heart has not been touched; if it had been, Herbert would be dead!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CDead!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, with a groan.</p>"
- <p>The sailor had only heard the last words uttered by the reporter.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNo, Pencroft,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cno! He is not dead. His\
  \ pulse still beats. He has even uttered a moan. But for your boy\u2019s sake, calm\
  \ yourself. We have need of all our self\u2011possession.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDo not make us lose it, my friend.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Pencroft was silent, but a reaction set in, and great tears rolled down his cheeks.</p>
- <p>In the meanwhile, Gideon Spilett endeavored to collect his ideas, and proceed
  methodically. After his examination he had no doubt that the ball, entering in front,
  between the seventh and eighth ribs, had issued behind between the third and fourth.
  But what mischief had the ball committed in its passage? What important organs had
  been reached? A professional surgeon would have had difficulty in determining this
  at once, and still more so the reporter.</p>
- <p>However, he knew one thing, this was that he would have to prevent the inflammatory
  strangulation of the injured parts, then to contend with the local inflammation
  and fever which would result from the wound, perhaps mortal! Now, what styptics,
  what antiphlogistics ought to be employed? By what means could inflammation be prevented?</p>
- <p>At any rate, the most important thing was that the two wounds should be dressed
  without delay. It did not appear necessary to Gideon Spilett that a fresh flow of
  blood should be caused by bathing them in tepid water, and compressing their lips.
  The hemorrhage had been very abundant, and Herbert was already too much enfeebled
  by the loss of blood.</p>
- <p>The reporter, therefore, thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds with
  cold water.</p>
- <p>Herbert was placed on his left side, and was maintained in that position.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHe must not be moved.\u201D said Gideon Spilett. \u201CHe is in the most\
  \ favorable position for the wounds in his back and chest to suppurate easily, and\
  \ absolute rest is necessary.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat! can\u2019t we carry him to Granite House?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Pencroft,\u201D replied the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI\u2019ll pay the villains off!\u201D cried the sailor, shaking his fist\
  \ in a menacing manner.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPencroft!\u201D said Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- <p>Gideon Spilett had resumed his examination of the wounded boy. Herbert was still
  so frightfully pale, that the reporter felt anxious.</p>
- "<p>\u201CCyrus,\u201D said he, \u201CI am not a surgeon. I am in terrible perplexity.\
  \ You must aid me with your advice, your experience!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTake courage, my friend,\u201D answered the engineer, pressing the reporter\u2019\
  s hand. \u201CJudge coolly. Think only of this: Herbert must be saved!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>These words restored to Gideon Spilett that self\u2011possession which he had\
  \ lost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his great responsibility. He seated\
  \ himself close to the bed. Cyrus Harding stood near. Pencroft had torn up his shirt,\
  \ and was mechanically making lint.</p>"
- <p>Spilett then explained to Cyrus Harding that he thought he ought first of all
  to stop the hemorrhage, but not close the two wounds, or cause their immediate cicatrization,
  for there had been internal perforation, and the suppuration must not be allowed
  to accumulate in the chest.</p>
- <p>Harding approved entirely, and it was decided that the two wounds should be dressed
  without attempting to close them by immediate coaptation.</p>
- <p>And now did the colonists possess an efficacious agent to act against the inflammation
  which might occur?</p>
- <p>Yes. They had one, for nature had generously lavished it. They had cold water,
  that is to say, the most powerful sedative that can be employed against inflammation
  of wounds, the most efficacious therapeutic agent in grave cases, and the one which
  is now adopted by all physicians. Cold water has, moreover, the advantage of leaving
  the wound in absolute rest, and preserving it from all premature dressing, a considerable
  advantage, since it has been found by experience that contact with the air is dangerous
  during the first days.</p>
- "<p>Gideon Spilett and Cyrus Harding reasoned thus with their simple good sense,\
  \ and they acted as the best surgeon would have done. Compresses of linen were applied\
  \ to poor Herbert\u2019s two wounds, and were kept constantly wet with cold water.</p>"
- <p>The sailor had at first lighted a fire in the hut, which was not wanting in things
  necessary for life. Maple sugar, medicinal plants, the same which the lad had gathered
  on the banks of Lake Grant, enabled them to make some refreshing drinks, which they
  gave him without his taking any notice of it. His fever was extremely high, and
  all that day and night passed without his becoming conscious.</p>
- "<p>Herbert\u2019s life hung on a thread, and this thread might break at any moment.\
  \ The next day, the 12th of November, the hopes of Harding and his companions slightly\
  \ revived. Herbert had come out of his long stupor. He opened his eyes, he recognized\
  \ Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Pencroft. He uttered two or three words. He did\
  \ not know what had happened. They told him, and Spilett begged him to remain perfectly\
  \ still, telling him that his life was not in danger, and that his wounds would\
  \ heal in a few days. However, Herbert scarcely suffered at all, and the cold water\
  \ with which they were constantly bathed, prevented any inflammation of the wounds.\
  \ The suppuration was established in a regular way, the fever did not increase,\
  \ and it might now be hoped that this terrible wound would not involve any catastrophe.\
  \ Pencroft felt the swelling of his heart gradually subside. He was like a sister\
  \ of mercy, like a mother by the bed of her child.</p>"
- <p>Herbert dozed again, but his sleep appeared more natural.</p>
- "<p>\u201CTell me again that you hope, Mr. Spilett,\u201D said Pencroft. \u201C\
  Tell me again that you will save Herbert!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, we will save him!\u201D replied the reporter. \u201CThe wound is\
  \ serious, and, perhaps, even the ball has traversed the lungs, but the perforation\
  \ of this organ is not fatal.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGod bless you!\u201D answered Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>As may be believed, during the four\u2011and\u2011twenty hours they had been\
  \ in the corral, the colonists had no other thought than that of nursing Herbert.\
  \ They did not think either of the danger which threatened them should the convicts\
  \ return, or of the precautions to be taken for the future.</p>"
- "<p>But on this day, while Pencroft watched by the sick\u2011bed, Cyrus Harding\
  \ and the reporter consulted as to what it would be best to do.</p>"
- "<p>First of all they examined the corral. There was not a trace of Ayrton. Had\
  \ the unhappy man been dragged away by his former accomplices? Had he resisted,\
  \ and been overcome in the struggle? This last supposition was only too probable.\
  \ Gideon Spilett, at the moment he scaled the palisade, had clearly seen some one\
  \ of the convicts running along the southern spur of Mount Franklin, towards whom\
  \ Top had sprung. It was one of those whose object had been so completely defeated\
  \ by the rocks at the mouth of the Mercy. Besides, the one killed by Harding, and\
  \ whose body was found outside the enclosure, of course belonged to Bob Harvey\u2019\
  s crew.</p>"
- <p>As to the corral, it had not suffered any damage. The gates were closed, and
  the animals had not been able to disperse in the forest. Nor could they see traces
  of any struggle, any devastation, either in the hut, or in the palisade. The ammunition
  only, with which Ayrton had been supplied, had disappeared with him.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe unhappy man has been surprised,\u201D said Harding, \u201Cand as he\
  \ was a man to defend himself, he must have been overpowered.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, that is to be feared!\u201D said the reporter. \u201CThen, doubtless,\
  \ the convicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of everything,\
  \ and only fled when they saw us coming. It is very evident, too, that at this moment\
  \ Ayrton, whether living or dead, is not here!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall have to beat the forest,\u201D said the engineer, \u201Cand rid\
  \ the island of these wretches. Pencroft\u2019s presentiments were not mistaken,\
  \ when he wished to hunt them as wild beasts. That would have spared us all these\
  \ misfortunes!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D answered the reporter, \u201Cbut now we have the right to be\
  \ merciless!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt any rate,\u201D said the engineer, \u201Cwe are obliged to wait some\
  \ time, and to remain at the corral until we can carry Herbert without danger to\
  \ Granite House.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut Neb?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNeb is in safety.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe must not come!\u201D returned Cyrus Harding quickly. \u201CHe would\
  \ be murdered on the road!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is very probable, however, that he will attempt to rejoin us!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh, if the telegraph still acted, he might be warned! But that is impossible\
  \ now! As to leaving Pencroft and Herbert here alone, we could not do it! Well,\
  \ I will go alone to Granite House.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, no! Cyrus,\u201D answered the reporter, \u201Cyou must not expose\
  \ yourself! Your courage would be of no avail. The villains are evidently watching\
  \ the corral, they are hidden in the thick woods which surround it, and if you go\
  \ we shall soon have to regret two misfortunes instead of one!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut Neb?\u201D repeated the engineer. \u201CIt is now four\u2011and\u2011\
  twenty hours since he has had any news of us! He will be sure to come!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd as he will be less on his guard than we should be ourselves,\u201D\
  \ added Spilett, \u201Che will be killed!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIs there really no way of warning him?\u201D</p>"
- <p>While the engineer thought, his eyes fell on Top, who, going backwards and forwards
  seemed to say,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CAm not I here?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTop!\u201D exclaimed Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>The animal sprang at his master\u2019s call.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Top will go,\u201D said the reporter, who had understood the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTop can go where we cannot! He will carry to Granite House the news of\
  \ the corral, and he will bring back to us that from Granite House!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CQuick!\u201D said Harding. \u201CQuick!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Spilett rapidly tore a leaf from his note\u2011book, and wrote these words:?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHerbert wounded. We are at the corral. Be on your guard. Do not leave\
  \ Granite House. Have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood? Reply by Top.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>This laconic note contained all that Neb ought to know, and at the same time\
  \ asked all that the colonists wished to know. It was folded and fastened to Top\u2019\
  s collar in a conspicuous position.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTop, my dog,\u201D said the engineer, caressing the animal, \u201CNeb,\
  \ Top! Neb! Go, go!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Top bounded at these words. He understood, he knew what was expected of him.
  The road to the corral was familiar to him. In less than an hour he could clear
  it, and it might be hoped that where neither Cyrus Harding nor the reporter could
  have ventured without danger, Top, running among the grass or in the wood, would
  pass unperceived.</p>
- <p>The engineer went to the gate of the corral and opened it.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNeb, Top! Neb!\u201D repeated the engineer, again pointing in the direction\
  \ of Granite House.</p>"
- <p>Top sprang forwards, then almost immediately disappeared.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHe will get there!\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, and he will come back, the faithful animal!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat o\u2019clock is it?\u201D asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTen.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn an hour he may be here. We will watch for his return.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The gate of the corral was closed. The engineer and the reporter re\u2011entered\
  \ the house. Herbert was still in a sleep. Pencroft kept the compresses always wet.\
  \ Spilett, seeing there was nothing he could do at that moment, busied himself in\
  \ preparing some nourishment, while attentively watching that part of the enclosure\
  \ against the hill, at which an attack might be expected.</p>"
- "<p>The settlers awaited Top\u2019s return with much anxiety. A little before eleven\
  \ o\u2019clock, Cyrus Harding and the reporter, rifle in hand, were behind the gate,\
  \ ready to open it at the first bark of their dog.</p>"
- <p>They did not doubt that if Top had arrived safely at Granite House, Neb would
  have sent him back immediately.</p>
- <p>They had both been there for about ten minutes, when a report was heard, followed
  by repeated barks.</p>
- <p>The engineer opened the gate, and seeing smoke a hundred feet off in the wood,
  he fired in that direction.</p>
- <p>Almost immediately Top bounded into the corral, and the gate was quickly shut.</p>
- "<p>\u201CTop, Top!\u201D exclaimed the engineer, taking the dog\u2019s great honest\
  \ head between his hands.</p>"
- "<p>A note was fastened to his neck, and Cyrus Harding read these words, traced\
  \ in Neb\u2019s large writing:?\u201CNo pirates in the neighborhood of Granite House.\
  \ I will not stir. Poor Mr. Herbert!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 8</p>
- "<p>So the convicts were still there, watching the corral, and determined to kill\
  \ the settlers one after the other. There was nothing to be done but to treat them\
  \ as wild beasts. But great precautions must be taken, for just now the wretches\
  \ had the advantage on their side, seeing, and not being seen, being able to surprise\
  \ by the suddenness of their attack, yet not to be surprised themselves. Harding\
  \ made arrangements, therefore, for living in the corral, of which the provisions\
  \ would last for a tolerable length of time. Ayrton\u2019s house had been provided\
  \ with all that was necessary for existence, and the convicts, scared by the arrival\
  \ of the settlers, had not had time to pillage it. It was probable, as Gideon Spilett\
  \ observed, that things had occurred as follows:</p>"
- "<p>The six convicts, disembarking on the island, had followed the southern shore,\
  \ and after having traversed the double shore of the Serpentine Peninsula, not being\
  \ inclined to venture into the Far West woods, they had reached the mouth of Falls\
  \ River. From this point, by following the right bank of the watercourse, they would\
  \ arrive at the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which they would naturally seek a\
  \ retreat, and they could not have been long in discovering the corral, then uninhabited.\
  \ There they had regularly installed themselves, awaiting the moment to put their\
  \ abominable schemes into execution. Ayrton\u2019s arrival had surprised them, but\
  \ they had managed to overpower the unfortunate man, and?the rest may be easily\
  \ imagined!</p>"
- <p>Now, the convicts,?reduced to five, it is true, but well armed,?were roaming
  the woods, and to venture there was to expose themselves to their attacks, which
  could be neither guarded against nor prevented.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWait! There is nothing else to be done!\u201D repeated Cyrus Harding.\
  \ \u201CWhen Herbert is cured, we can organize a general battle of the island, and\
  \ have satisfaction of these convicts. That will be the object of our grand expedition\
  \ at the same time?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAs the search for our mysterious protector,\u201D added Gideon Spilett,\
  \ finishing the engineer\u2019s sentence. \u201CAnd it must be acknowledged, my\
  \ dear Cyrus, that this time his protection was wanting at the very moment when\
  \ it was most necessary to us!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho knows?\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat we are not at the end of our trouble yet, my dear Spilett, and that\
  \ his powerful intervention may have another opportunity of exercising itself. But\
  \ that is not the question now. Herbert\u2019s life before everything.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>This was the colonists\u2019 saddest thought. Several days passed, and the poor\
  \ boy\u2019s state was happily no worse. Cold water, always kept at a suitable temperature,\
  \ had completely prevented the inflammation of the wounds. It even seemed to the\
  \ reporter that this water, being slightly sulphurous,?which was explained by the\
  \ neighborhood of the volcano, had a more direct action on the healing. The suppuration\
  \ was much less abundant, and thanks to the incessant care by which he was surrounded!?Herbert\
  \ returned to life, and his fever abated. He was besides subjected to a severe diet,\
  \ and consequently his weakness was and would be extreme; but there was no want\
  \ of refreshing drinks, and absolute rest was of the greatest benefit to him. Cyrus\
  \ Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft had become very skilful in dressing the\
  \ lad\u2019s wounds. All the linen in the house had been sacrificed. Herbert\u2019\
  s wounds, covered with compresses and lint, were pressed neither too much nor too\
  \ little, so as to cause their cicatrization without effecting any inflammatory\
  \ reaction. The reporter used extreme care in the dressing, knowing well the importance\
  \ of it, and repeating to his companions that which most surgeons willingly admit,\
  \ that it is perhaps rarer to see a dressing well done than an operation well performed.</p>"
- <p>In ten days, on the 22nd of November, Herbert was considerably better. He had
  begun to take some nourishment.</p>
- "<p>The color was returning to his cheeks, and his bright eyes smiled at his nurses.\
  \ He talked a little, notwithstanding Pencroft\u2019s efforts, who talked incessantly\
  \ to prevent him from beginning to speak, and told him the most improbable stories.\
  \ Herbert had questioned him on the subject of Ayrton, whom he was astonished not\
  \ to see near him, thinking that he was at the corral. But the sailor, not wishing\
  \ to distress Herbert, contented himself by replying that Ayrton had rejoined Neb,\
  \ so as to defend Granite House.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHumph!\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cthese pirates! they are gentlemen who\
  \ have no right to any consideration! And the captain wanted to win them by kindness!\
  \ I\u2019ll send them some kindness, but in the shape of a good bullet!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd have they not been seen again?\u201D asked Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, my boy,\u201D answered the sailor, \u201Cbut we shall find them, and\
  \ when you are cured we shall see if the cowards who strike us from behind will\
  \ dare to meet us face to face!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am still very weak, my poor Pencroft!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell! your strength will return gradually! What\u2019s a ball through\
  \ the chest? Nothing but a joke! I\u2019ve seen many, and I don\u2019t think much\
  \ of them!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>At last things appeared to be going on well, and if no complication occurred,\
  \ Herbert\u2019s recovery might be regarded as certain. But what would have been\
  \ the condition of the colonists if his state had been aggravated,?if, for example,\
  \ the ball had remained in his body, if his arm or his leg had had to be amputated?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D said Spilett more than once, \u201CI have never thought of such\
  \ a contingency without shuddering!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd yet, if it had been necessary to operate,\u201D said Harding one day\
  \ to him, \u201Cyou would not have hesitated?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Cyrus!\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cbut thank God that we have\
  \ been spared this complication!\u201D</p>"
- <p>As in so many other conjectures, the colonists had appealed to the logic of that
  simple good sense of which they had made use so often, and once more, thanks to
  their general knowledge, it had succeeded! But might not a time come when all their
  science would be at fault? They were alone on the island. Now, men in all states
  of society are necessary to each other. Cyrus Harding knew this well, and sometimes
  he asked if some circumstance might not occur which they would be powerless to surmount.
  It appeared to him besides, that he and his companions, till then so fortunate,
  had entered into an unlucky period. During the two years and a half which had elapsed
  since their escape from Richmond, it might be said that they had had everything
  their own way. The island had abundantly supplied them with minerals, vegetables,
  animals, and as Nature had constantly loaded them, their science had known how to
  take advantage of what she offered them.</p>
- <p>The wellbeing of the colony was therefore complete. Moreover, in certain occurrences
  an inexplicable influence had come to their aid!... But all that could only be for
  a time.</p>
- <p>In short, Cyrus Harding believed that fortune had turned against them.</p>
- "<p>In fact, the convicts\u2019 ship had appeared in the waters of the island, and\
  \ if the pirates had been, so to speak, miraculously destroyed, six of them, at\
  \ least, had escaped the catastrophe. They had disembarked on the island, and it\
  \ was almost impossible to get at the five who survived. Ayrton had no doubt been\
  \ murdered by these wretches, who possessed firearms, and at the first use that\
  \ they had made of them, Herbert had fallen, wounded almost mortally. Were these\
  \ the first blows aimed by adverse fortune at the colonists? This was often asked\
  \ by Harding. This was often repeated by the reporter; and it appeared to him also\
  \ that the intervention, so strange, yet so efficacious, which till then had served\
  \ them so well, had now failed them. Had this mysterious being, whatever he was,\
  \ whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island? Had he in his turn\
  \ succumbed?</p>"
- <p>No reply was possible to these questions. But it must not be imagined that because
  Harding and his companions spoke of these things, they were men to despair. Far
  from that. They looked their situation in the face, they analyzed the chances, they
  prepared themselves for any event, they stood firm and straight before the future,
  and if adversity was at last to strike them, it would find in them men prepared
  to struggle against it.</p>
- <p>Chapter 9</p>
- <p>The convalescence of the young invalid was regularly progressing. One thing only
  was now to be desired, that his state would allow him to be brought to Granite House.
  However well built and supplied the corral house was, it could not be so comfortable
  as the healthy granite dwelling. Besides, it did not offer the same security, and
  its tenants, notwithstanding their watchfulness, were here always in fear of some
  shot from the convicts. There, on the contrary, in the middle of that impregnable
  and inaccessible cliff, they would have nothing to fear, and any attack on their
  persons would certainly fail. They therefore waited impatiently for the moment when
  Herbert might be moved without danger from his wound, and they were determined to
  make this move, although the communication through Jacamar Wood was very difficult.</p>
- <p>They had no news from Neb, but were not uneasy on that account. The courageous
  Negro, well entrenched in the depths of Granite House, would not allow himself to
  be surprised. Top had not been sent again to him, as it appeared useless to expose
  the faithful dog to some shot which might deprive the settlers of their most useful
  auxiliary.</p>
- "<p>They waited, therefore, although they were anxious to be reunited at Granite\
  \ House. It pained the engineer to see his forces divided, for it gave great advantage\
  \ to the pirates. Since Ayrton\u2019s disappearance they were only four against\
  \ five, for Herbert could not yet be counted, and this was not the least care of\
  \ the brave boy, who well understood the trouble of which he was the cause.</p>"
- <p>The question of knowing how, in their condition, they were to act against the
  pirates, was thoroughly discussed on the 29th of November by Cyrus Harding, Gideon
  Spilett, and Pencroft, at a moment when Herbert was asleep and could not hear them.</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friends,\u201D said the reporter, after they had talked of Neb and\
  \ of the impossibility of communicating with him, \u201CI think,?like you, that\
  \ to venture on the road to the corral would be to risk receiving a gunshot without\
  \ being able to return it. But do you not think that the best thing to be done now\
  \ is to openly give chase to these wretches?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is just what I was thinking,\u201D answered Pencroft. \u201CI believe\
  \ we\u2019re not fellows to be afraid of a bullet, and as for me, if Captain Harding\
  \ approves, I\u2019m ready to dash into the forest! Why, hang it, one man is equal\
  \ to another!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut is he equal to five?\u201D asked the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI will join Pencroft,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cand both of us, well\u2011\
  armed and accompanied by Top?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy dear Spilett, and you, Pencroft,\u201D answered Harding, \u201Clet\
  \ us reason coolly. If the convicts were hid in one spot of the island, if we knew\
  \ that spot, and had only to dislodge them, I would undertake a direct attack; but\
  \ is there not occasion to fear, on the contrary, that they are sure to fire the\
  \ first shot?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, captain,\u201D cried Pencroft, \u201Ca bullet does not always reach\
  \ its mark.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat which struck Herbert did not miss, Pencroft,\u201D replied the engineer.\
  \ \u201CBesides, observe that if both of you left the corral I should remain here\
  \ alone to defend it. Do you imagine that the convicts will not see you leave it,\
  \ that they will not allow you to enter the forest, and that they will not attack\
  \ it during your absence, knowing that there is no one here but a wounded boy and\
  \ a man?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are right, captain,\u201D replied Pencroft, his chest swelling with\
  \ sullen anger. \u201CYou are right; they will do all they can to retake the corral,\
  \ which they know to be well stored; and alone you could not hold it against them.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201COh, if we were only at Granite House!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf we were at Granite House,\u201D answered the engineer, \u201Cthe case\
  \ would be very different. There I should not be afraid to leave Herbert with one,\
  \ while the other three went to search the forests of the island. But we are at\
  \ the corral, and it is best to stay here until we can leave it together.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding\u2019s reasoning was unanswerable, and his companions understood\
  \ it well.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf only Ayrton was still one of us!\u201D said Gideon Spilett. \u201C\
  Poor fellow! his return to social life will have been but of short duration.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf he is dead,\u201D added Pencroft, in a peculiar tone.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDo you hope, then, Pencroft, that the villains have spared him?\u201D\
  \ asked Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, if they had any interest in doing so.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat! you suppose that Ayrton finding his old companions, forgetting all\
  \ that he owes us?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho knows?\u201D answered the sailor, who did not hazard this shameful\
  \ supposition without hesitating.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPencroft,\u201D said Harding, taking the sailor\u2019s arm, \u201Cthat\
  \ is a wicked idea of yours, and you will distress me much if you persist in speaking\
  \ thus. I will answer for Ayrton\u2019s fidelity.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd I also,\u201D added the reporter quickly.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, yes, captain, I was wrong,\u201D replied Pencroft; \u201Cit was a\
  \ wicked idea indeed that I had, and nothing justifies it. But what can I do? I\u2019\
  m not in my senses. This imprisonment in the corral wearies me horribly, and I have\
  \ never felt so excited as I do now.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBe patient, Pencroft,\u201D replied the engineer. \u201CHow long will\
  \ it be, my dear Spilett, before you think Herbert may be carried to Granite House?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is difficult to say, Cyrus,\u201D answered the reporter, \u201Cfor\
  \ any imprudence might involve terrible consequences. But his convalescence is progressing,\
  \ and if he continues to gain strength, in eight days from now?well, we shall see.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Eight days! That would put off the return to Granite House until the first days
  of December. At this time two months of spring had already passed. The weather was
  fine, and the heat began to be great. The forests of the island were in full leaf,
  and the time was approaching when the usual crops ought to be gathered. The return
  to the plateau of Prospect Heights would, therefore, be followed by extensive agricultural
  labors, interrupted only by the projected expedition through the island.</p>
- <p>It can, therefore, be well understood how injurious this seclusion in the corral
  must have been to the colonists.</p>
- <p>But if they were compelled to bow before necessity, they did not do so without
  impatience.</p>
- <p>Once or twice the reporter ventured out into the road and made the tour of the
  palisade. Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett, his gun cocked, was ready for
  any emergency.</p>
- <p>He met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces. His dog would have
  warned him of any danger, and, as Top did not bark, it might be concluded that there
  was nothing to fear at the moment at least, and that the convicts were occupied
  in another part of the island.</p>
- <p>However, on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Gideon Spilett, who had
  ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods, towards the south of the mountain,
  remarked that Top scented something. The dog had no longer his unconcerned manner;
  he went backwards and forwards, ferreting among the grass and bushes as if his smell
  had revealed some suspicious object to him.</p>
- "<p>Gideon Spilett followed Top, encouraged him, excited him by his voice, while\
  \ keeping a sharp look\u2011out, his gun ready to fire, and sheltering himself behind\
  \ the trees. It was not probable that Top scented the presence of man, for in that\
  \ case, he would have announced it by half\u2011uttered, sullen, angry barks. Now,\
  \ as he did not growl, it was because danger was neither near nor approaching.</p>"
- <p>Nearly five minutes passed thus, Top rummaging, the reporter following him prudently
  when, all at once, the dog rushed towards a thick bush, and drew out a rag.</p>
- "<p>It was a piece of cloth, stained and torn, which Spilett immediately brought\
  \ back to the corral. There it was examined by the colonists, who found that it\
  \ was a fragment of Ayrton\u2019s waistcoat, a piece of that felt, manufactured\
  \ solely by the Granite House factory.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou see, Pencroft,\u201D observed Harding, \u201Cthere has been resistance\
  \ on the part of the unfortunate Ayrton. The convicts have dragged him away in spite\
  \ of himself! Do you still doubt his honesty?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, captain,\u201D answered the sailor, \u201Cand I repented of my suspicion\
  \ a long time ago! But it seems to me that something may be learned from the incident.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is that?\u201D asked the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is that Ayrton was not killed at the corral! That they dragged him\
  \ away living, since he has resisted. Therefore, perhaps, he is still living!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CPerhaps, indeed,\u201D replied the engineer, who remained thoughtful.</p>"
- "<p>This was a hope, to which Ayrton\u2019s companions could still hold. Indeed,\
  \ they had before believed that, surprised in the corral, Ayrton had fallen by a\
  \ bullet, as Herbert had fallen. But if the convicts had not killed him at first,\
  \ if they had brought him living to another part of the island, might it not be\
  \ admitted that he was still their prisoner? Perhaps, even, one of them had found\
  \ in Ayrton his old Australian companion Ben Joyce, the chief of the escaped convicts.\
  \ And who knows but that they had conceived the impossible hope of bringing back\
  \ Ayrton to themselves? He would have been very useful to them, if they had been\
  \ able to make him turn traitor!</p>"
- <p>This incident was, therefore, favorably interpreted at the corral, and it no
  longer appeared impossible that they should find Ayrton again. On his side, if he
  was only a prisoner, Ayrton would no doubt do all he could to escape from the hands
  of the villains, and this would be a powerful aid to the settlers!</p>
- "<p>\u201CAt any rate,\u201D observed Gideon Spilett, \u201Cif happily Ayrton did\
  \ manage to escape, he would go directly to Granite House, for he could not know\
  \ of the attempted assassination of which Herbert has been a victim, and consequently\
  \ would never think of our being imprisoned in the corral.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh! I wish that he was there, at Granite House!\u201D cried Pencroft,\
  \ \u201Cand that we were there, too! For, although the rascals can do nothing to\
  \ our house, they may plunder the plateau, our plantations, our poultry\u2011yard!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Pencroft had become a thorough farmer, heartily attached to his crops. But it
  must be said that Herbert was more anxious than any to return to Granite House,
  for he knew how much the presence of the settlers was needed there. And it was he
  who was keeping them at the corral! Therefore, one idea occupied his mind?to leave
  the corral, and when! He believed he could bear removal to Granite House. He was
  sure his strength would return more quickly in his room, with the air and sight
  of the sea!</p>
- "<p>Several times he pressed Gideon Spilett, but the latter, fearing, with good\
  \ reason, that Herbert\u2019s wounds, half healed, might reopen on the way, did\
  \ not give the order to start.</p>"
- "<p>However, something occurred which compelled Cyrus Harding and his two friends\
  \ to yield to the lad\u2019s wish, and God alone knew that this determination might\
  \ cause them grief and remorse.</p>"
- "<p>It was the 29th of November, seven o\u2019clock in the evening. The three settlers\
  \ were talking in Herbert\u2019s room, when they heard Top utter quick barks.</p>"
- <p>Harding, Pencroft, and Spilett seized their guns and ran out of the house. Top,
  at the foot of the palisade, was jumping, barking, but it was with pleasure, not
  anger.</p>
- "<p>\u201CSome one is coming.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is not an enemy!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNeb, perhaps?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COr Ayrton?\u201D</p>"
- <p>These words had hardly been exchanged between the engineer and his two companions
  when a body leaped over the palisade and fell on the ground inside the corral.</p>
- <p>It was Jup, Master Jup in person, to whom Top immediately gave a most cordial
  reception.</p>
- "<p>\u201CJup!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNeb has sent him to us,\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Che must have some note on him.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Pencroft rushed up to the orang. Certainly if Neb had any important matter to
  communicate to his master he could not employ a more sure or more rapid messenger,
  who could pass where neither the colonists could, nor even Top himself.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding was not mistaken. At Jup\u2019s neck hung a small bag, and in\
  \ this bag was found a little note traced by Neb\u2019s hand.</p>"
- <p>The despair of Harding and his companions may be imagined when they read these
  words:?</p>
- "<p>\u201CFriday, six o\u2019clock in the morning.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPlateau invaded by convicts.</p>"
- "<p>                             \u201CNeb.\u201D</p>"
- <p> </p>
- "<p>They gazed at each other without uttering a word, then they re\u2011entered\
  \ the house. What were they to do? The convicts on Prospect Heights! that was disaster,\
  \ devastation, ruin.</p>"
- "<p>Herbert, on seeing the engineer, the reporter, and Pencroft re\u2011enter, guessed\
  \ that their situation was aggravated, and when he saw Jup, he no longer doubted\
  \ that some misfortune menaced Granite House.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Harding,\u201D said he, \u201CI must go; I can bear the journey.\
  \ I must go.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Gideon Spilett approached Herbert; then, having looked at him,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CLet us go, then!\u201D said he.</p>"
- <p>The question was quickly decided whether Herbert should be carried on a litter
  or in the cart which had brought Ayrton to the corral. The motion of the litter
  would have been more easy for the wounded lad, but it would have necessitated two
  bearers, that is to say, there would have been two guns less for defense if an attack
  was made on the road. Would they not, on the contrary, by employing the cart leave
  every arm free? Was it impossible to place the mattress on which Herbert was lying
  in it, and to advance with so much care that any jolt should be avoided? It could
  be done.</p>
- "<p>The cart was brought. Pencroft harnessed the onager. Cyrus Harding and the reporter\
  \ raised Herbert\u2019s mattress and placed it on the bottom of the cart. The weather\
  \ was fine. The sun\u2019s bright rays glanced through the trees.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAre the guns ready?\u201D asked Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>They were. The engineer and Pencroft, each armed with a double\u2011barreled\
  \ gun, and Gideon Spilett carrying his rifle, had nothing to do but start.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAre you comfortable, Herbert?\u201D asked the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh, captain,\u201D replied the lad, \u201Cdon\u2019t be uneasy, I shall\
  \ not die on the road!\u201D</p>"
- <p>While speaking thus, it could be seen that the poor boy had called up all his
  energy, and by the energy of a powerful will had collected his failing strength.</p>
- <p>The engineer felt his heart sink painfully. He still hesitated to give the signal
  for departure; but that would have driven Herbert to despair?killed him perhaps.</p>
- "<p>\u201CForward!\u201D said Harding.</p>"
- <p>The gate of the corral was opened. Jup and Top, who knew when to be silent, ran
  in advance. The cart came out, the gate was reclosed, and the onager, led by Pencroft,
  advanced at a slow pace.</p>
- <p>Certainly, it would have been safer to have taken a different road than that
  which led straight from the corral to Granite House, but the cart would have met
  with great difficulties in moving under the trees. It was necessary, therefore,
  to follow this way, although it was well known to the convicts.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett walked one on each side of the cart, ready to
  answer to any attack. However, it was not probable that the convicts would have
  yet left the plateau of Prospect Heights.</p>
- "<p>Neb\u2019s note had evidently been written and sent as soon as the convicts\
  \ had shown themselves there. Now, this note was dated six o\u2019clock in the morning,\
  \ and the active orang, accustomed to come frequently to the corral, had taken scarcely\
  \ three quarters of an hour to cross the five miles which separated it from Granite\
  \ House. They would, therefore, be safe at that time, and if there was any occasion\
  \ for firing, it would probably not be until they were in the neighborhood of Granite\
  \ House. However, the colonists kept a strict watch. Top and Jup, the latter armed\
  \ with his club, sometimes in front, sometimes beating the wood at the sides of\
  \ the road, signalized no danger.</p>"
- "<p>The cart advanced slowly under Pencroft\u2019s guidance. It had left the corral\
  \ at half\u2011past seven. An hour after, four out of the five miles had been cleared,\
  \ without any incident having occurred. The road was as deserted as all that part\
  \ of the Jacamar Wood which lay between the Mercy and the lake. There was no occasion\
  \ for any warning. The wood appeared as deserted as on the day when the colonists\
  \ first landed on the island.</p>"
- <p>They approached the plateau. Another mile and they would see the bridge over
  Creek Glycerine. Cyrus Harding expected to find it in its place; supposing that
  the convicts would have crossed it, and that, after having passed one of the streams
  which enclosed the plateau, they would have taken the precaution to lower it again,
  so as to keep open a retreat.</p>
- "<p>At length an opening in the trees allowed the sea\u2011horizon to be seen. But\
  \ the cart continued its progress, for not one of its defenders thought of abandoning\
  \ it.</p>"
- <p>At that moment Pencroft stopped the onager, and in a hoarse voice,?</p>
- "<p>\u201COh! the villains!\u201D he exclaimed.</p>"
- "<p>And he pointed to a thick smoke rising from the mill, the sheds, and the buildings\
  \ at the poultry\u2011yard.</p>"
- <p>A man was moving about in the midst of the smoke. It was Neb.</p>
- <p>His companions uttered a shout. He heard, and ran to meet them.</p>
- "<p>The convicts had left the plateau nearly half\u2011an\u2011hour before, having\
  \ devastated it!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd Mr. Herbert?\u201D asked Neb.</p>"
- <p>Gideon Spilett returned to the cart.</p>
- <p>Herbert had lost consciousness!</p>
- <p>Chapter 10</p>
- "<p>Of the convicts, the dangers which menaced Granite House, the ruins with which\
  \ the plateau was covered, the colonists thought no longer. Herbert\u2019s critical\
  \ state outweighed all other considerations. Would the removal prove fatal to him\
  \ by causing some internal injury? The reporter could not affirm it, but he and\
  \ his companions almost despaired of the result. The cart was brought to the bend\
  \ of the river. There some branches, disposed as a liner, received the mattress\
  \ on which lay the unconscious Herbert. Ten minutes after, Cyrus Harding, Spilett,\
  \ and Pencroft were at the foot of the cliff, leaving Neb to take the cart on to\
  \ the plateau of Prospect Heights. The lift was put in motion, and Herbert was soon\
  \ stretched on his bed in Granite House.</p>"
- <p>What cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life! He smiled for a moment
  on finding himself in his room, but could scarcely even murmur a few words, so great
  was his weakness. Gideon Spilett examined his wounds. He feared to find them reopened,
  having been imperfectly healed. There was nothing of the sort. From whence, then,
  came this prostration? why was Herbert so much worse? The lad then fell into a kind
  of feverish sleep, and the reporter and Pencroft remained near the bed. During this
  time, Harding told Neb all that had happened at the corral, and Neb recounted to
  his master the events of which the plateau had just been the theater.</p>
- "<p>It was only during the preceding night that the convicts had appeared on the\
  \ edge of the forest, at the approaches to Creek Glycerine. Neb, who was watching\
  \ near the poultry\u2011yard, had not hesitated to fire at one of the pirates, who\
  \ was about to cross the stream; but in the darkness he could not tell whether the\
  \ man had been hit or not. At any rate, it was not enough to frighten away the band,\
  \ and Neb had only just time to get up to Granite House, where at least he was in\
  \ safety.</p>"
- '<p>But what was he to do there? How prevent the devastations with which the convicts
  threatened the plateau? Had Neb any means by which to warn his master? And, besides,
  in what situation were the inhabitants of the corral themselves? Cyrus Harding and
  his companions had left on the 11th of November, and it was now the 29th. It was,
  therefore, nineteen days since Neb had had other news than that brought by Top?disastrous
  news: Ayrton disappeared, Herbert severely wounded, the engineer, reporter, and
  sailor, as it were, imprisoned in the corral!</p>'
- <p>What was he to do? asked poor Neb. Personally he had nothing to fear, for the
  convicts could not reach him in Granite House. But the buildings, the plantations,
  all their arrangements at the mercy of the pirates! Would it not be best to let
  Cyrus Harding judge of what he ought to do, and to warn him, at least, of the danger
  which threatened him?</p>
- "<p>Neb then thought of employing Jup, and confiding a note to him. He knew the\
  \ orang\u2019s great intelligence, which had been often put to the proof. Jup understood\
  \ the word corral, which had been frequently pronounced before him, and it may be\
  \ remembered, too, that he had often driven the cart thither in company with Pencroft.\
  \ Day had not yet dawned. The active orang would know how to pass unperceived through\
  \ the woods, of which the convicts, besides, would think he was a native.</p>"
- "<p>Neb did not hesitate. He wrote the note, he tied it to Jup\u2019s neck, he brought\
  \ the ape to the door of Granite House, from which he let down a long cord to the\
  \ ground; then, several times he repeated these words,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CJup Jup! corral, corral!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The creature understood, seized the cord, glided rapidly down the beach, and\
  \ disappeared in the darkness without the convicts\u2019 attention having been in\
  \ the least excited.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou did well, Neb,\u201D said Harding, \u201Cbut perhaps in not warning\
  \ us you would have done still better!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And, in speaking thus, Cyrus Harding thought of Herbert, whose recovery the removal
  had so seriously checked.</p>
- "<p>Neb ended his account. The convicts had not appeared at all on the beach. Not\
  \ knowing the number of the island\u2019s inhabitants, they might suppose that Granite\
  \ House was defended by a large party. They must have remembered that during the\
  \ attack by the brig numerous shot had been fired both from the lower and upper\
  \ rocks, and no doubt they did not wish to expose themselves. But the plateau of\
  \ Prospect Heights was open to them, and not covered by the fire of Granite House.\
  \ They gave themselves up, therefore, to their instinct of destruction,?plundering,\
  \ burning, devastating everything,?and only retiring half an hour before the arrival\
  \ of the colonists, whom they believed still confined in the corral.</p>"
- "<p>On their retreat, Neb hurried out. He climbed the plateau at the risk of being\
  \ perceived and fired at, tried to extinguish the fire which was consuming the buildings\
  \ of the poultry\u2011yard, and had struggled, though in vain, against it until\
  \ the cart appeared at the edge of the wood.</p>"
- <p>Such had been these serious events. The presence of the convicts constituted
  a permanent source of danger to the settlers in Lincoln Island, until then so happy,
  and who might now expect still greater misfortunes.</p>
- <p>Spilett remained in Granite House with Herbert and Pencroft, while Cyrus Harding,
  accompanied by Neb, proceeded to judge for himself of the extent of the disaster.</p>
- <p>It was fortunate that the convicts had not advanced to the foot of Granite House.
  The workshop at the Chimneys would in that case not have escaped destruction. But
  after all, this evil would have been more easily reparable than the ruins accumulated
  on the plateau of Prospect Heights. Harding and Neb proceeded towards the Mercy,
  and ascended its left bank without meeting with any trace of the convicts; nor on
  the other side of the river, in the depths of the wood, could they perceive any
  suspicious indications.</p>
- <p>Besides, it might be supposed that in all probability either the convicts knew
  of the return of the settlers to Granite House, by having seen them pass on the
  road from the corral, or, after the devastation of the plateau, they had penetrated
  into Jacamar Wood, following the course of the Mercy, and were thus ignorant of
  their return.</p>
- <p>In the former case, they must have returned towards the corral, now without defenders,
  and which contained valuable stores.</p>
- <p>In the latter, they must have regained their encampment, and would wait on opportunity
  to recommence the attack.</p>
- "<p>It was, therefore, possible to prevent them, but any enterprise to clear the\
  \ island was now rendered difficult by reason of Herbert\u2019s condition. Indeed,\
  \ their whole force would have been barely sufficient to cope with the convicts,\
  \ and just now no one could leave Granite House.</p>"
- "<p>The engineer and Neb arrived on the plateau. Desolation reigned everywhere.\
  \ The fields had been trampled over; the ears of wheat, which were nearly full\u2011\
  grown, lay on the ground. The other plantations had not suffered less.</p>"
- "<p>The kitchen\u2011garden was destroyed. Happily, Granite House possessed a store\
  \ of seed which would enable them to repair these misfortunes.</p>"
- "<p>As to the wall and buildings of the poultry\u2011yard and the onagers stable,\
  \ the fire had destroyed all. A few terrified creatures roamed over the plateau.\
  \ The birds, which during the fire had taken refuge on the waters of the lake, had\
  \ already returned to their accustomed spot, and were dabbling on the banks. Everything\
  \ would have to be reconstructed.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding\u2019s face, which was paler than usual, expressed an internal\
  \ anger which he commanded with difficulty, but he did not utter a word. Once more\
  \ he looked at his devastated fields, and at the smoke which still rose from the\
  \ ruins, then he returned to Granite House.</p>"
- "<p>The following days were the saddest of any that the colonists had passed on\
  \ the island! Herbert\u2019s weakness visibly increased. It appeared that a more\
  \ serious malady, the consequence of the profound physiological disturbance he had\
  \ gone through, threatened to declare itself, and Gideon Spilett feared such an\
  \ aggravation of his condition that he would be powerless to fight against it!</p>"
- "<p>In fact, Herbert remained in an almost continuous state of drowsiness, and symptoms\
  \ of delirium began to manifest themselves. Refreshing drinks were the only remedies\
  \ at the colonists\u2019 disposal. The fever was not as yet very high, but it soon\
  \ appeared that it would probably recur at regular intervals. Gideon Spilett first\
  \ recognized this on the 6th of December.</p>"
- <p>The poor boy, whose fingers, nose, and ears had become extremely pale, was at
  first seized with slight shiverings, horripilations, and tremblings. His pulse was
  weak and irregular, his skin dry, his thirst intense. To this soon succeeded a hot
  fit; his face became flushed; his skin reddened; his pulse quick; then a profuse
  perspiration broke out after which the fever seemed to diminish. The attack had
  lasted nearly five hours.</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett had not left Herbert, who, it was only too certain, was now seized
  by an intermittent fever, and this fever must be cured at any cost before it should
  assume a more serious aspect.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAnd in order to cure it,\u201D said Spilett to Cyrus Harding, \u201Cwe\
  \ need a febrifuge.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA febrifuge?\u201D answered the engineer. \u201CWe have neither Peruvian\
  \ bark, nor sulphate of quinine.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Cbut there are willows on the border\
  \ of the lake, and the bark of the willow might, perhaps, prove to be a substitute\
  \ for quinine.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us try it without losing a moment,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>The bark of the willow has, indeed, been justly considered as a succedaneum\
  \ for Peruvian bark, as has also that of the horse\u2011chestnut tree, the leaf\
  \ of the holly, the snake\u2011root, etc. It was evidently necessary to make trial\
  \ of this substance, although not so valuable as Peruvian bark, and to employ it\
  \ in its natural state, since they had no means for extracting its essence.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of black willow,
  a few pieces of bark; he brought them back to Granite House, and reduced them to
  a powder, which was administered that same evening to Herbert.</p>
- <p>The night passed without any important change. Herbert was somewhat delirious,
  but the fever did not reappear in the night, and did not return either during the
  following day.</p>
- <p>Pencroft again began to hope. Gideon Spilett said nothing. It might be that the
  fever was not quotidian, but tertian, and that it would return next day. Therefore,
  he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety.</p>
- "<p>It might have been remarked besides that during this period Herbert remained\
  \ utterly prostrate, his head weak and giddy. Another symptom alarmed the reporter\
  \ to the highest degree. Herbert\u2019s liver became congested, and soon a more\
  \ intense delirium showed that his brain was also affected.</p>"
- <p>Gideon Spilett was overwhelmed by this new complication. He took the engineer
  aside.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is a malignant fever,\u201D said he.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA malignant fever!\u201D cried Harding. \u201CYou are mistaken, Spilett.\
  \ A malignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously; its germ must previously\
  \ have existed.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am not mistaken,\u201D replied the reporter. \u201CHerbert no doubt\
  \ contracted the germ of this fever in the marshes of the island. He has already\
  \ had one attack; should a second come on and should we not be able to prevent a\
  \ third, he is lost.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut the willow bark?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is insufficient,\u201D answered the reporter, \u201Cand the third\
  \ attack of a malignant fever, which is not arrested by means of quinine, is always\
  \ fatal.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Fortunately, Pencroft heard nothing of this conversation or he would have gone
  mad.</p>
- <p>It may be imagined what anxiety the engineer and the reporter suffered during
  the day of the 7th of December and the following night.</p>
- "<p>Towards the middle of the day the second attack came on. The crisis was terrible.\
  \ Herbert felt himself sinking. He stretched his arms towards Cyrus Harding, towards\
  \ Spilett, towards Pencroft. He was so young to die! The scene was heart\u2011rending.\
  \ They were obliged to send Pencroft away.</p>"
- <p>The fit lasted five hours. It was evident that Herbert could not survive a third.</p>
- <p>The night was frightful. In his delirium Herbert uttered words which went to
  the hearts of his companions. He struggled with the convicts, he called to Ayrton,
  he poured forth entreaties to that mysterious being,?that powerful unknown protector,?whose
  image was stamped upon his mind; then he again fell into a deep exhaustion which
  completely prostrated him. Several times Gideon Spilett thought that the poor boy
  was dead.</p>
- "<p>The next day, the 8th of December, was but a succession of the fainting fits.\
  \ Herbert\u2019s thin hands clutched the sheets. They had administered further doses\
  \ of pounded bark, but the reporter expected no result from it.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIf before tomorrow morning we have not given him a more energetic febrifuge,\u201D\
  \ said the reporter, \u201CHerbert will be dead.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Night arrived?the last night, it was too much to be feared, of the good, brave,
  intelligent boy, so far in advance of his years, and who was loved by all as their
  own child. The only remedy which existed against this terrible malignant fever,
  the only specific which could overcome it, was not to be found in Lincoln Island.</p>
- <p>During the night of the 8th of December, Herbert was seized by a more violent
  delirium. His liver was fearfully congested, his brain affected, and already it
  was impossible for him to recognize any one.</p>
- <p>Would he live until the next day, until that third attack which must infallibly
  carry him off? It was not probable. His strength was exhausted, and in the intervals
  of fever he lay as one dead.</p>
- "<p>Towards three o\u2019clock in the morning Herbert uttered a piercing cry. He\
  \ seemed to be torn by a supreme convulsion. Neb, who was near him, terrified, ran\
  \ into the next room where his companions were watching.</p>"
- <p>Top, at that moment, barked in a strange manner.</p>
- <p>All rushed in immediately and managed to restrain the dying boy, who was endeavoring
  to throw himself out of his bed, while Spilett, taking his arm, felt his pulse gradually
  quicken.</p>
- "<p>It was five in the morning. The rays of the rising sun began to shine in at\
  \ the windows of Granite House. It promised to be a fine day, and this day was to\
  \ be poor Herbert\u2019s last!</p>"
- <p>A ray glanced on the table placed near the bed.</p>
- <p>Suddenly Pencroft, uttering a cry, pointed to the table.</p>
- "<p>On it lay a little oblong box, of which the cover bore these words:?\u201CSULPHATE\
  \ OF QUININE.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 11</p>
- "<p>Gideon Spilett took the box and opened it. It contained nearly two hundred grains\
  \ of a white powder, a few particles of which he carried to his lips. The extreme\
  \ bitterness of the substance precluded all doubt; it was certainly the precious\
  \ extract of quinine, that pre\u2011eminent antifebrile.</p>"
- <p>This powder must be administered to Herbert without delay. How it came there
  might be discussed later.</p>
- "<p>\u201CSome coffee!\u201D said Spilett.</p>"
- <p>In a few moments Neb brought a cup of the warm infusion. Gideon Spilett threw
  into it about eighteen grains of quinine, and they succeeded in making Herbert drink
  the mixture.</p>
- <p>There was still time, for the third attack of the malignant fever had not yet
  shown itself. How they longed to be able to add that it would not return!</p>
- <p>Besides, it must be remarked, the hopes of all had now revived. The mysterious
  influence had been again exerted, and in a critical moment, when they had despaired
  of it.</p>
- <p>In a few hours Herbert was much calmer. The colonists could now discuss this
  incident. The intervention of the stranger was more evident than ever. But how had
  he been able to penetrate during the night into Granite House? It was inexplicable,
  and, in truth, the proceedings of the genius of the island were not less mysterious
  than was that genius himself. During this day the sulphate of quinine was administered
  to Herbert every three hours.</p>
- "<p>The next day some improvement in Herbert\u2019s condition was apparent. Certainly,\
  \ he was not out of danger, intermittent fevers being subject to frequent and dangerous\
  \ relapses, but the most assiduous care was bestowed on him. And besides, the specific\
  \ was at hand; nor, doubtless, was he who had brought it far distant! And the hearts\
  \ of all were animated by returning hope.</p>"
- "<p>This hope was not disappointed. Ten days after, on the 20th of December, Herbert\u2019\
  s convalescence commenced.</p>"
- <p>He was still weak, and strict diet had been imposed upon him, but no access of
  fever supervened. And then, the poor boy submitted with such docility to all the
  prescriptions ordered him! He longed so to get well!</p>
- <p>Pencroft was as a man who has been drawn up from the bottom of an abyss. Fits
  of joy approaching delirium seized him. When the time for the third attack had passed
  by, he nearly suffocated the reporter in his embrace. Since then, he always called
  him Dr. Spilett.</p>
- <p>The real doctor, however, remained undiscovered.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe will find him!\u201D repeated the sailor.</p>"
- <p>Certainly, this man, whoever he was, might expect a somewhat too energetic embrace
  from the worthy Pencroft!</p>
- "<p>The month of December ended, and with it the year 1867, during which the colonists\
  \ of Lincoln Island had of late been so severely tried. They commenced the year\
  \ 1868 with magnificent weather, great heat, and a tropical temperature, delightfully\
  \ cooled by the sea\u2011breeze. Herbert\u2019s recovery progressed, and from his\
  \ bed, placed near one of the windows of Granite House, he could inhale the fresh\
  \ air, charged with ozone, which could not fail to restore his health. His appetite\
  \ returned, and what numberless delicate, savory little dishes Neb prepared for\
  \ him!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is enough to make one wish to have a fever oneself!\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>During all this time, the convicts did not once appear in the vicinity of Granite
  House. There was no news of Ayrton, and though the engineer and Herbert still had
  some hopes of finding him again, their companions did not doubt but that the unfortunate
  man had perished. However, this uncertainty could not last, and when once the lad
  should have recovered, the expedition, the result of which must be so important,
  would be undertaken. But they would have to wait a month, perhaps, for all the strength
  of the colony must be put into requisition to obtain satisfaction from the convicts.</p>
- "<p>However, Herbert\u2019s convalescence progressed rapidly. The congestion of\
  \ the liver had disappeared, and his wounds might be considered completely healed.</p>"
- "<p>During the month of January, important work was done on the plateau of Prospect\
  \ Heights; but it consisted solely in saving as much as was possible from the devastated\
  \ crops, either of corn or vegetables. The grain and the plants were gathered, so\
  \ as to provide a new harvest for the approaching half\u2011season. With regard\
  \ to rebuilding the poultry\u2011yard, wall, or stables, Cyrus Harding preferred\
  \ to wait. While he and his companions were in pursuit of the convicts, the latter\
  \ might very probably pay another visit to the plateau, and it would be useless\
  \ to give them an opportunity of recommencing their work of destruction. When the\
  \ island should be cleared of these miscreants, they would set about rebuilding.\
  \ The young convalescent began to get up in the second week of January, at first\
  \ for one hour a day, then two, then three. His strength visibly returned, so vigorous\
  \ was his constitution. He was now eighteen years of age. He was tall, and promised\
  \ to become a man of noble and commanding presence. From this time his recovery,\
  \ while still requiring care,?and Dr. Spilett was very strict,?made rapid progress.\
  \ Towards the end of the month, Herbert was already walking about on Prospect Heights,\
  \ and the beach.</p>"
- "<p>He derived, from several sea\u2011baths, which he took in company with Pencroft\
  \ and Neb, the greatest possible benefit. Cyrus Harding thought he might now settle\
  \ the day for their departure, for which the 15th of February was fixed. The nights,\
  \ very clear at this time of year, would be favorable to the researches they intended\
  \ to make all over the island.</p>"
- <p>The necessary preparations for this exploration were now commenced, and were
  important, for the colonists had sworn not to return to Granite House until their
  twofold object had been achieved; on the one hand, to exterminate the convicts,
  and rescue Ayrton, if he was still living; on the other, to discover who it was
  that presided so effectually over the fortunes of the colony.</p>
- <p>Of Lincoln Island, the settlers knew thoroughly all the eastern coast from Claw
  Cape to the Mandible Capes, the extensive Tadorn Marsh, the neighborhood of Lake
  Grant, Jacamar Wood, between the road to the corral and the Mercy, the courses of
  the Mercy and Red Creek, and lastly, the spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the
  corral had been established.</p>
- <p>They had explored, though only in an imperfect manner, the vast shore of Washington
  Bay from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the woody and marshy border of the west coast,
  and the interminable downs, ending at the open mouth of Shark Gulf. But they had
  in no way surveyed the woods which covered the Serpentine Peninsula, all to the
  right of the Mercy, the left bank of Falls River, and the wilderness of spurs and
  valleys which supported three quarters of the base of Mount Franklin, to the east,
  the north, and the west, and where doubtless many secret retreats existed. Consequently,
  many millions of acres of the island had still escaped their investigations.</p>
- <p>It was, therefore, decided that the expedition should be carried through the
  Far West, so as to include all that region situated on the right of the Mercy.</p>
- "<p>It might, perhaps, be better worth while to go direct to the corral, where it\
  \ might be supposed that the convicts had again taken refuge, either to pillage\
  \ or to establish themselves there. But either the devastation of the corral would\
  \ have been an accomplished fact by this time, and it would be too late to prevent\
  \ it, or it had been the convicts\u2019 interest to entrench themselves there, and\
  \ there would be still time to go and turn them out on their return.</p>"
- <p>Therefore, after some discussion, the first plan was adhered to, and the settlers
  resolved to proceed through the wood to Reptile End. They would make their way with
  their hatchets, and thus lay the first draft of a road which would place Granite
  House in communication with the end of the peninsula for a length of from sixteen
  to seventeen miles.</p>
- <p>The cart was in good condition. The onagers, well rested, could go a long journey.
  Provisions, camp effects, a portable stove, and various utensils were packed in
  the cart, as also weapons and ammunition, carefully chosen from the now complete
  arsenal of Granite House. But it was necessary to remember that the convicts were,
  perhaps, roaming about the woods, and that in the midst of these thick forests a
  shot might quickly be fired and received. It was therefore resolved that the little
  band of settlers should remain together and not separate under any pretext whatever.</p>
- <p>It was also decided that no one should remain at Granite House. Top and Jup themselves
  were to accompany the expedition; the inaccessible dwelling needed no guard. The
  14th of February, eve of the departure, was consecrated entirely to repose, and?thanksgiving
  addressed by the colonists to the Creator. A place in the cart was reserved for
  Herbert, who, though thoroughly convalescent, was still a little weak. The next
  morning, at daybreak, Cyrus Harding took the necessary measures to protect Granite
  House from any invasion. The ladders, which were formerly used for the ascent, were
  brought to the Chimneys and buried deep in the sand, so that they might be available
  on the return of the colonists, for the machinery of the lift had been taken to
  pieces, and nothing of the apparatus remained. Pencroft stayed the last in Granite
  House in order to finish this work, and he then lowered himself down by means of
  a double rope held below, and which, when once hauled down, left no communication
  between the upper landing and the beach.</p>
- <p>The weather was magnificent.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe shall have a warm day of it,\u201D said the reporter, laughing.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPooh! Dr. Spilett,\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201Cwe shall walk under\
  \ the shade of the trees and shan\u2019t even see the sun!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CForward!\u201D said the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>The cart was waiting on the beach before the Chimneys. The reporter made Herbert\
  \ take his place in it during the first hours at least of the journey, and the lad\
  \ was obliged to submit to his doctor\u2019s orders.</p>"
- "<p>Neb placed himself at the onagers\u2019 heads. Cyrus Harding, the reporter,\
  \ and the sailor, walked in front. Top bounded joyfully along. Herbert offered a\
  \ seat in his vehicle to Jup, who accepted it without ceremony. The moment for departure\
  \ had arrived, and the little band set out.</p>"
- <p>The cart first turned the angle of the mouth of the Mercy, then, having ascended
  the left bank for a mile, crossed the bridge, at the other side of which commenced
  the road to Port Balloon, and there the explorers, leaving this road on their left,
  entered the cover of the immense woods which formed the region of the Far West.</p>
- <p>For the first two miles the widely scattered trees allowed the cart to pass with
  ease; from time to time it became necessary to cut away a few creepers and bushes,
  but no serious obstacle impeded the progress of the colonists.</p>
- "<p>The thick foliage of the trees threw a grateful shade on the ground. Deodars,\
  \ Douglas firs, casuarinas, banksias, gum\u2011trees, dragon\u2011trees, and other\
  \ well\u2011known species, succeeded each other far as the eye could reach. The\
  \ feathered tribes of the island were all represented?grouse, jacamars, pheasants,\
  \ lories, as well as the chattering cockatoos, parrots, and paroquets. Agouties,\
  \ kangaroos, and capybaras fled swiftly at their approach; and all this reminded\
  \ the settlers of the first excursions they had made on their arrival at the island.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNevertheless,\u201D observed Cyrus Harding, \u201CI notice that these\
  \ creatures, both birds and quadrupeds, are more timid than formerly. These woods\
  \ have, therefore, been recently traversed by the convicts, and we shall certainly\
  \ find some traces of them.\u201D</p>"
- <p>And, in fact, in several places they could distinguish traces, more or less recent,
  of the passage of a band of men?here branches broken off the trees, perhaps to mark
  out the way; there the ashes of a fire, and footprints in clayey spots; but nothing
  which appeared to belong to a settled encampment.</p>
- <p>The engineer had recommended his companions to refrain from hunting. The reports
  of the firearms might give the alarm to the convicts, who were, perhaps, roaming
  through the forest. Moreover, the hunters would necessarily ramble some distance
  from the cart, which it was dangerous to leave unguarded.</p>
- <p>In the afterpart of the day, when about six miles from Granite House, their progress
  became much more difficult. In order to make their way through some thickets, they
  were obliged to cut down trees. Before entering such places Harding was careful
  to send in Top and Jup, who faithfully accomplished their commission, and when the
  dog and orang returned without giving any warning, there was evidently nothing to
  fear, either from convicts or wild beasts, two varieties of the animal kingdom,
  whose ferocious instincts placed them on the same level. On the evening of the first
  day the colonists encamped about nine miles from Granite House, on the border of
  a little stream falling into the Mercy, and of the existence of which they had till
  then been ignorant; it evidently, however, belonged to the hydiographical system
  to which the soil owed its astonishing fertility. The settlers made a hearty meal,
  for their appetites were sharpened, and measures were then taken that the night
  might be passed in safety. If the engineer had had only to deal with wild beasts,
  jaguars or others, he would have simply lighted fires all around his camp, which
  would have sufficed for its defense; but the convicts would be rather attracted
  than terrified by the flames, and it was, therefore, better to be surrounded by
  the profound darkness of night.</p>
- <p>The watch was, however, carefully organized. Two of the settlers were to watch
  together, and every two hours it was agreed that they should be relieved by their
  comrades. And so, notwithstanding his wish to the contrary, Herbert was exempted
  from guard. Pencroft and Gideon Spilett in one party, the engineer and Neb in another,
  mounted guard in turns over the camp.</p>
- <p>The night, however, was but of few hours. The darkness was due rather to the
  thickness of the foliage than to the disappearance of the sun. The silence was scarcely
  disturbed by the howling of jaguars and the chattering of the monkeys, the latter
  appearing to particularly irritate Master Jup. The night passed without incident,
  and on the next day, the 15th of February, the journey through the forest, tedious
  rather than difficult, was continued. This day they could not accomplish more than
  six miles, for every moment they were obliged to cut a road with their hatchets.</p>
- <p>Like true settlers, the colonists spared the largest and most beautiful trees,
  which would besides have cost immense labor to fell, and the small ones only were
  sacrificed, but the result was that the road took a very winding direction, and
  lengthened itself by numerous detours.</p>
- "<p>During the day Herbert discovered several new specimens not before met with\
  \ in the island, such as the tree\u2011fern, with its leaves spread out like the\
  \ waters of a fountain, locust\u2011trees, on the long pods of which the onagers\
  \ browsed greedily, and which supplied a sweet pulp of excellent flavor. There,\
  \ too, the colonists again found groups of magnificent kauries, their cylindrical\
  \ trunks, crowded with a cone of verdure, rising to a height of two hundred feet.\
  \ These were the tree\u2011kings of New Zealand, as celebrated as the cedars of\
  \ Lebanon.</p>"
- <p>As to the fauna, there was no addition to those species already known to the
  hunters. Nevertheless, they saw, though unable to get near them, a couple of those
  large birds peculiar to Australia, a sort of cassowary, called emu, five feet in
  height, and with brown plumage, which belong to the tribe of waders. Top darted
  after them as fast as his four legs could carry him, but the emus distanced him
  with ease, so prodigious was their speed.</p>
- "<p>As to the traces left by the convicts, a few more were discovered. Some footprints\
  \ found near an apparently recently extinguished fire were attentively examined\
  \ by the settlers. By measuring them one after the other, according to their length\
  \ and breadth, the marks of five men\u2019s feet were easily distinguished. The\
  \ five convicts had evidently camped on this spot; but,?and this was the object\
  \ of so minute an examination,?a sixth footprint could not be discovered, which\
  \ in that case would have been that of Ayrton.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAyrton was not with them!\u201D said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201Cand if he was not with them, it was\
  \ because the wretches had already murdered him! but then these rascals have not\
  \ a den to which they may be tracked like tigers!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied the reporter, \u201Cit is more probable that they wander\
  \ at random, and it is their interest to rove about until the time when they will\
  \ be masters of the island!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe masters of the island!\u201D exclaimed the sailor; \u201Cthe masters\
  \ of the island!...\u201D he repeated, and his voice was choked, as if his throat\
  \ was seized in an iron grasp. Then in a calmer tone, \u201CDo you know, Captain\
  \ Harding,\u201D said he, \u201Cwhat the ball is which I have rammed into my gun?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Pencroft!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is the ball that went through Herbert\u2019s chest, and I promise you\
  \ it won\u2019t miss its mark!\u201D</p>"
- <p>But this just retaliation would not bring Ayrton back to life, and from the examination
  of the footprints left in the ground, they must, alas! conclude that all hopes of
  ever seeing him again must be abandoned.</p>
- <p>That evening they encamped fourteen miles from Granite House, and Cyrus Harding
  calculated that they could not be more than five miles from Reptile Point.</p>
- <p>And indeed, the next day the extremity of the peninsula was reached, and the
  whole length of the forest had been traversed; but there was nothing to indicate
  the retreat in which the convicts had taken refuge, nor that, no less secret, which
  sheltered the mysterious unknown.</p>
- <p>Chapter 12</p>
- <p>The next day, the 18th of February, was devoted to the exploration of all that
  wooded region forming the shore from Reptile End to Falls River. The colonists were
  able to search this forest thoroughly, for, as it was comprised between the two
  shores of the Serpentine Peninsula, it was only from three to four miles in breadth.
  The trees, both by their height and their thick foliage, bore witness to the vegetative
  power of the soil, more astonishing here than in any other part of the island. One
  might have said that a corner from the virgin forests of America or Africa had been
  transported into this temperate zone. This led them to conclude that the superb
  vegetation found a heat in this soil, damp in its upper layer, but warmed in the
  interior by volcanic fires, which could not belong to a temperate climate. The most
  frequently occurring trees were knaries and eucalypti of gigantic dimensions.</p>
- "<p>But the colonists\u2019 object was not simply to admire the magnificent vegetation.\
  \ They knew already that in this respect Lincoln Island would have been worthy to\
  \ take the first rank in the Canary group, to which the first name given was that\
  \ of the Happy Isles. Now, alas! their island no longer belonged to them entirely;\
  \ others had taken possession of it, miscreants polluted its shores, and they must\
  \ be destroyed to the last man.</p>"
- <p>No traces were found on the western coast, although they were carefully sought
  for. No more footprints, no more broken branches, no more deserted camps.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThis does not surprise me,\u201D said Cyrus Harding to his companions.\
  \ \u201CThe convicts first landed on the island in the neighborhood of Flotsam Point,\
  \ and they immediately plunged into the Far West forests, after crossing Tadorn\
  \ Marsh. They then followed almost the same route that we took on leaving Granite\
  \ House. This explains the traces we found in the wood. But, arriving on the shore,\
  \ the convicts saw at once that they would discover no suitable retreat there, and\
  \ it was then that, going northwards again, they came upon the corral.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhere they have perhaps returned,\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI do not think so,\u201D answered the engineer, \u201Cfor they would naturally\
  \ suppose that our researches would be in that direction. The corral is only a storehouse\
  \ to them, and not a definitive encampment.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am of Cyrus\u2019 opinion,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cand I think\
  \ that it is among the spurs of Mount Franklin that the convicts will have made\
  \ their lair.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen, captain, straight to the corral!\u201D cried Pencroft. \u201CWe\
  \ must finish them off, and till now we have only lost time!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, my friend,\u201D replied the engineer; \u201Cyou forget that we have\
  \ a reason for wishing to know if the forests of the Far West do not contain some\
  \ habitation. Our exploration has a double object, Pencroft. If, on the one hand,\
  \ we have to chastise crime, we have, on the other, an act of gratitude to perform.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat was well said, captain,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cbut, all\
  \ the same, it is my opinion that we shall not find the gentleman until he pleases.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>And truly Pencroft only expressed the opinion of all. It was probable that the\
  \ stranger\u2019s retreat was not less mysterious than was he himself.</p>"
- <p>That evening the cart halted at the mouth of Falls River. The camp was organized
  as usual, and the customary precautions were taken for the night. Herbert, become
  again the healthy and vigorous lad he was before his illness, derived great benefit
  from this life in the open air, between the sea breezes and the vivifying air from
  the forests. His place was no longer in the cart, but at the head of the troop.</p>
- <p>The next day, the 19th of February, the colonists, leaving the shore, where,
  beyond the mouth, basalts of every shape were so picturesquely piled up, ascended
  the river by its left bank. The road had been already partly cleared in their former
  excursions made from the corral to the west coast. The settlers were now about six
  miles from Mount Franklin.</p>
- "<p>The engineer\u2019s plan was this:?To minutely survey the valley forming the\
  \ bed of the river, and to cautiously approach the neighborhood of the corral; if\
  \ the corral was occupied, to seize it by force; if it was not, to entrench themselves\
  \ there and make it the center of the operations which had for their object the\
  \ exploration of Mount Franklin.</p>"
- <p>This plan was unanimously approved by the colonists, for they were impatient
  to regain entire possession of their island.</p>
- "<p>They made their way then along the narrow valley separating two of the largest\
  \ spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees, crowded on the river\u2019s bank, became rare\
  \ on the upper slopes of the mountain. The ground was hilly and rough, very suitable\
  \ for ambushes, and over which they did not venture without extreme precaution.\
  \ Top and Jup skirmished on the flanks, springing right and left through the thick\
  \ brushwood, and emulating each other in intelligence and activity. But nothing\
  \ showed that the banks of the stream had been recently frequented?nothing announced\
  \ either the presence or the proximity of the convicts. Towards five in the evening\
  \ the cart stopped nearly 600 feet from the palisade. A semicircular screen of trees\
  \ still hid it.</p>"
- <p>It was necessary to reconnoiter the corral, in order to ascertain if it was occupied.
  To go there openly, in broad daylight, when the convicts were probably in ambush,
  would be to expose themselves, as poor Herbert had done, to the firearms of the
  ruffians. It was better, then, to wait until night came on.</p>
- <p>However, Gideon Spilett wished without further delay to reconnoiter the approaches
  to the corral, and Pencroft, who was quite out of patience, volunteered to accompany
  him.</p>
- "<p>\u201CNo, my friends,\u201D said the engineer, \u201Cwait till night. I will\
  \ not allow one of you to expose himself in open day.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, captain?\u201D answered the sailor, little disposed to obey.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI beg of you, Pencroft,\u201D said the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CVery well!\u201D replied the sailor, who vented his anger in another way,\
  \ by bestowing on the convicts the worst names in his maritime vocabulary.</p>"
- <p>The colonists remained, therefore, near the cart, and carefully watched the neighboring
  parts of the forest.</p>
- "<p>Three hours passed thus. The wind had fallen, and absolute silence reigned under\
  \ the great trees. The snapping of the smallest twig, a footstep on the dry leaves,\
  \ the gliding of a body among the grass, would have been heard without difficulty.\
  \ All was quiet. Besides, Top, lying on the grass, his head stretched out on his\
  \ paws, gave no sign of uneasiness. At eight o\u2019clock the day appeared far enough\
  \ advanced for the reconnaissance to be made under favorable conditions. Gideon\
  \ Spilett declared himself ready to set out accompanied by Pencroft. Cyrus Harding\
  \ consented. Top and Jup were to remain with the engineer, Herbert, and Neb, for\
  \ a bark or a cry at a wrong moment would give the alarm.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDo not be imprudent,\u201D said Harding to the reporter and Pencroft,\
  \ \u201Cyou have not to gain possession of the corral, but only to find out whether\
  \ it is occupied or not.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAll right,\u201D answered Pencroft.</p>"
- <p>And the two departed.</p>
- <p>Under the trees, thanks to the thickness of their foliage, the obscurity rendered
  any object invisible beyond a radius of from thirty to forty feet. The reporter
  and Pencroft, halting at any suspicious sound, advanced with great caution.</p>
- <p>They walked a little distance apart from each other so as to offer a less mark
  for a shot. And, to tell the truth, they expected every moment to hear a report.
  Five minutes after leaving the cart, Gideon Spilett and Pencroft arrived at the
  edge of the wood before the clearing beyond which rose the palisade.</p>
- '<p>They stopped. A few straggling beams still fell on the field clear of trees.
  Thirty feet distant was the gate of the corral, which appeared to be closed. This
  thirty feet, which it was necessary to cross from the wood to the palisade, constituted
  the dangerous zone, to borrow a ballistic term: in fact, one or more bullets fired
  from behind the palisade might knock over any one who ventured on to this zone.
  Gideon Spilett and the sailor were not men to draw back, but they knew that any
  imprudence on their part, of which they would be the first victims, would fall afterwards
  on their companions. If they themselves were killed, what would become of Harding,
  Neb, and Herbert?</p>'
- <p>But Pencroft, excited at feeling himself so near the corral where he supposed
  the convicts had taken refuge, was about to press forward, when the reporter held
  him back with a grasp of iron.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIn a few minutes it will be quite dark,\u201D whispered Spilett in the\
  \ sailor\u2019s ear, \u201Cthen will be the time to act.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft, convulsively clasping the butt\u2011end of his gun, restrained his\
  \ energies, and waited, swearing to himself.</p>"
- <p>Soon the last of the twilight faded away. Darkness, which seemed as if it issued
  from the dense forest, covered the clearing. Mount Franklin rose like an enormous
  screen before the western horizon, and night spread rapidly over all, as it does
  in regions of low latitudes. Now was the time.</p>
- <p>The reporter and Pencroft, since posting themselves on the edge of the wood,
  had not once lost sight of the palisade. The corral appeared to be absolutely deserted.
  The top of the palisade formed a line, a little darker than the surrounding shadow,
  and nothing disturbed its distinctness. Nevertheless, if the convicts were there,
  they must have posted one of their number to guard against any surprise.</p>
- "<p>Spilett grasped his companion\u2019s hand, and both crept towards the corral,\
  \ their guns ready to fire.</p>"
- <p>They reached the gate without the darkness being illuminated by a single ray
  of light.</p>
- <p>Pencroft tried to push open the gate, which, as the reporter and he had supposed,
  was closed. However, the sailor was able to ascertain that the outer bars had not
  been put up. It might, then, be concluded that the convicts were there in the corral,
  and that very probably they had fastened the gate in such a way that it could not
  be forced open.</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett and Pencroft listened.</p>
- <p>Not a sound could be heard inside the palisade. The musmons and the goats, sleeping
  no doubt in their huts, in no way disturbed the calm of night.</p>
- "<p>The reporter and the sailor hearing nothing, asked themselves whether they had\
  \ not better scale the palisades and penetrate into the corral. This would have\
  \ been contrary to Cyrus Harding\u2019s instructions.</p>"
- <p>It is true that the enterprise might succeed, but it might also fail. Now, if
  the convicts were suspecting nothing, if they knew nothing of the expedition against
  them, if, lastly, there now existed a chance of surprising them, ought this chance
  to be lost by inconsiderately attempting to cross the palisades?</p>
- "<p>This was not the reporter\u2019s opinion. He thought it better to wait until\
  \ all the settlers were collected together before attempting to penetrate into the\
  \ corral. One thing was certain, that it was possible to reach the palisade without\
  \ being seen, and also that it did not appear to be guarded. This point settled,\
  \ there was nothing to be done but to return to the cart, where they would consult.</p>"
- <p>Pencroft probably agreed with this decision, for he followed the reporter without
  making any objection when the latter turned back to the wood.</p>
- <p>In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of affairs.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D said he, after a little thought, \u201CI now have reason to\
  \ believe that the convicts are not in the corral.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall soon know,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cwhen we have scaled the\
  \ palisade.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo the corral, my friends!\u201D said Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CShall we leave the cart in the wood?\u201D asked Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cit is our wagon of ammunition and\
  \ provisions, and, if necessary, it would serve as an entrenchment.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CForward, then!\u201D said Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>The cart emerged from the wood and began to roll noiselessly towards the palisade.\
  \ The darkness was now profound, the silence as complete as when Pencroft and the\
  \ reporter crept over the ground. The thick grass completely muffled their footsteps.\
  \ The colonists held themselves ready to fire. Jup, at Pencroft\u2019s orders, kept\
  \ behind. Neb led Top in a leash, to prevent him from bounding forward.</p>"
- "<p>The clearing soon came in sight. It was deserted. Without hesitating, the little\
  \ band moved towards the palisade. In a short space of time the dangerous zone was\
  \ passed. Neb remained at the onagers\u2019 heads to hold them. The engineer, the\
  \ reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the door, in order to ascertain\
  \ if it was barricaded inside. It was open!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat do you say now?\u201D asked the engineer, turning to the sailor and\
  \ Spilett.</p>"
- <p>Both were stupefied.</p>
- "<p>\u201CI can swear,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cthat this gate was shut just now!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The colonists now hesitated. Were the convicts in the corral when Pencroft and
  the reporter made their reconnaissance? It could not be doubted, as the gate then
  closed could only have been opened by them. Were they still there, or had one of
  their number just gone out?</p>
- <p>All these questions presented themselves simultaneously to the minds of the colonists,
  but how could they be answered?</p>
- "<p>At that moment, Herbert, who had advanced a few steps into the enclosure, drew\
  \ back hurriedly, and seized Harding\u2019s hand.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201D asked the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA light!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn the house?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>All five advanced and indeed, through the window fronting them, they saw glimmering\
  \ a feeble light. Cyrus Harding made up his mind rapidly. \u201CIt is our only chance,\u201D\
  \ said he to his companions, \u201Cof finding the convicts collected in this house,\
  \ suspecting nothing! They are in our power! Forward!\u201D The colonists crossed\
  \ through the enclosure, holding their guns ready in their hands. The cart had been\
  \ left outside under the charge of Jup and Top, who had been prudently tied to it.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Gideon Spilett on one side, Herbert and Neb on the
  other, going along by the palisade, surveyed the absolutely dark and deserted corral.</p>
- <p>In a few moments they were near the closed door of the house.</p>
- <p>Harding signed to his companions not to stir, and approached the window, then
  feebly lighted by the inner light.</p>
- <p>He gazed into the apartment.</p>
- <p>On the table burned a lantern. Near the table was the bed formerly used by Ayrton.</p>
- <p>On the bed lay the body of a man.</p>
- "<p>Suddenly Cyrus Harding drew back, and in a hoarse voice,?\u201CAyrton!\u201D\
  \ he exclaimed.</p>"
- <p>Immediately the door was forced rather than opened, and the colonists rushed
  into the room.</p>
- <p>Ayrton appeared to be asleep. His countenance showed that he had long and cruelly
  suffered. On his wrists and ankles could be seen great bruises.</p>
- <p>Harding bent over him.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAyrton!\u201D cried the engineer, seizing the arm of the man whom he had\
  \ just found again under such unexpected circumstances.</p>"
- <p>At this exclamation Ayrton opened his eyes, and, gazing at Harding, then at the
  others,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CYou!\u201D he cried, \u201Cyou?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAyrton! Ayrton!\u201D repeated Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhere am I?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn the house in the corral!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAlone?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut they will come back!\u201D cried Ayrton. \u201CDefend yourselves!\
  \ defend yourselves!\u201D</p>"
- <p>And he fell back exhausted.</p>
- "<p>\u201CSpilett,\u201D exclaimed the engineer, \u201Cwe may be attacked at any\
  \ moment. Bring the cart into the corral. Then, barricade the door, and all come\
  \ back here.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the engineer\u2019s orders.\
  \ There was not a moment to be lost. Perhaps even now the cart was in the hands\
  \ of the convicts!</p>"
- <p>In a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral and reached
  the gate of the palisade behind which Top was heard growling sullenly.</p>
- <p>The engineer, leaving Ayrton for an instant, came out ready to fire. Herbert
  was at his side. Both surveyed the crest of the spur overlooking the corral. If
  the convicts were lying in ambush there, they might knock the settlers over one
  after the other.</p>
- <p>At that moment the moon appeared in the east, above the black curtain of the
  forest, and a white sheet of light spread over the interior of the enclosure. The
  corral, with its clumps of trees, the little stream which watered it, its wide carpet
  of grass, was suddenly illuminated. From the side of the mountain, the house and
  a part of the palisade stood out white in the moonlight. On the opposite side towards
  the door, the enclosure remained dark. A black mass soon appeared. This was the
  cart entering the circle of light, and Cyrus Harding could hear the noise made by
  the door, as his companions shut it and fastened the interior bars.</p>
- <p>But, at that moment, Top, breaking loose, began to bark furiously and rush to
  the back of the corral, to the right of the house.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBe ready to fire, my friends!\u201D cried Harding.</p>"
- <p>The colonists raised their pieces and waited the moment to fire.</p>
- <p>Top still barked, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered shrill cries.</p>
- <p>The colonists followed him, and reached the borders of the little stream, shaded
  by large trees. And there, in the bright moonlight, what did they see? Five corpses,
  stretched on the bank!</p>
- <p>They were those of the convicts who, four months previously, had landed on Lincoln
  Island!</p>
- <p>Chapter 13</p>
- <p>How had it happened? who had killed the convicts? Was it Ayrton? No, for a moment
  before he was dreading their return.</p>
- <p>But Ayrton was now in a profound stupor, from which it was no longer possible
  to rouse him. After uttering those few words he had again become unconscious, and
  had fallen back motionless on the bed.</p>
- "<p>The colonists, a prey to a thousand confused thoughts, under the influence of\
  \ violent excitement, waited all night, without leaving Ayrton\u2019s house, or\
  \ returning to the spot where lay the bodies of the convicts. It was very probable\
  \ that Ayrton would not be able to throw any light on the circumstances under which\
  \ the bodies had been found, since he himself was not aware that he was in the corral.\
  \ But at any rate he would be in a position to give an account of what had taken\
  \ place before this terrible execution. The next day Ayrton awoke from his torpor,\
  \ and his companions cordially manifested all the joy they felt, on seeing him again,\
  \ almost safe and sound, after a hundred and four days separation.</p>"
- <p>Ayrton then in a few words recounted what had happened, or, at least, as much
  as he knew.</p>
- <p>The day after his arrival at the corral, on the 10th of last November, at nightfall,
  he was surprised by the convicts, who had scaled the palisade. They bound and gagged
  him; then he was led to a dark cavern, at the foot of Mount Franklin, where the
  convicts had taken refuge.</p>
- <p>His death had been decided upon, and the next day the convicts were about to
  kill him, when one of them recognized him and called him by the name which he bore
  in Australia. The wretches had no scruples as to murdering Ayrton! They spared Ben
  Joyce!</p>
- <p>But from that moment Ayrton was exposed to the importunities of his former accomplices.
  They wished him to join them again, and relied upon his aid to enable them to gain
  possession of Granite House, to penetrate into that hitherto inaccessible dwelling,
  and to become masters of the island, after murdering the colonists!</p>
- <p>Ayrton remained firm. The once convict, now repentant and pardoned, would rather
  die than betray his companions. Ayrton?bound, gagged, and closely watched?lived
  in this cave for four months.</p>
- "<p>Nevertheless the convicts had discovered the corral a short time after their\
  \ arrival in the island, and since then they had subsisted on Ayrton\u2019s stores,\
  \ but did not live at the corral.</p>"
- "<p>On the 11th of November, two of the villains, surprised by the colonists\u2019\
  \ arrival, fired at Herbert, and one of them returned, boasting of having killed\
  \ one of the inhabitants of the island; but he returned alone. His companion, as\
  \ is known, fell by Cyrus Harding\u2019s dagger.</p>"
- "<p>Ayrton\u2019s anxiety and despair may be imagined when he learned the news of\
  \ Herbert\u2019s death. The settlers were now only four, and, as it seemed, at the\
  \ mercy of the convicts. After this event, and during all the time that the colonists,\
  \ detained by Herbert\u2019s illness, remained in the corral, the pirates did not\
  \ leave their cavern, and even after they had pillaged the plateau of Prospect Heights,\
  \ they did not think it prudent to abandon it.</p>"
- "<p>The ill\u2011treatment inflicted on Ayrton was now redoubled. His hands and\
  \ feet still bore the bloody marks of the cords which bound him day and night. Every\
  \ moment he expected to be put to death, nor did it appear possible that he could\
  \ escape.</p>"
- <p>Matters remained thus until the third week of February. The convicts, still watching
  for a favorable opportunity, rarely quitted their retreat, and only made a few hunting
  excursions, either to the interior of the island, or the south coast.</p>
- "<p>Ayrton had no further news of his friends, and relinquished all hope of ever\
  \ seeing them again. At last, the unfortunate man, weakened by ill\u2011treatment,\
  \ fell into a prostration so profound that sight and hearing failed him. From that\
  \ moment, that is to say, since the last two days, he could give no information\
  \ whatever of what had occurred.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, Captain Harding,\u201D he added, \u201Csince I was imprisoned in\
  \ that cavern, how is it that I find myself in the corral?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHow is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the\
  \ enclosure?\u201D answered the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDead!\u201D cried Ayrton, half rising from his bed, notwithstanding his\
  \ weakness.</p>"
- <p>His companions supported him. He wished to get up, and with their assistance
  he did so. They then proceeded together towards the little stream.</p>
- <p>It was now broad daylight.</p>
- <p>There, on the bank, in the position in which they had been stricken by death
  in its most instantaneous form, lay the corpses of the five convicts!</p>
- <p>Ayrton was astounded. Harding and his companions looked at him without uttering
  a word. On a sign from the engineer, Neb and Pencroft examined the bodies, already
  stiffened by the cold.</p>
- <p>They bore no apparent trace of any wound.</p>
- <p>Only, after carefully examining them, Pencroft found on the forehead of one,
  on the chest of another, on the back of this one, on the shoulder of that, a little
  red spot, a sort of scarcely visible bruise, the cause of which it was impossible
  to conjecture.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is there that they have been struck!\u201D said Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut with what weapon?\u201D cried the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA weapon, lightning\u2011like in its effects, and of which we have not\
  \ the secret!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd who has struck the blow?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe avenging power of the island,\u201D replied Harding, \u201Che who\
  \ brought you here, Ayrton, whose influence has once more manifested itself, who\
  \ does for us all that which we cannot do for ourselves, and who, his will accomplished,\
  \ conceals himself from us.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us make search for him, then!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, we will search for him,\u201D answered Harding, \u201Cbut we shall\
  \ not discover this powerful being who performs such wonders, until he pleases to\
  \ call us to him!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>This invisible protection, which rendered their own action unavailing, both\
  \ irritated and piqued the engineer. The relative inferiority which it proved was\
  \ of a nature to wound a haughty spirit. A generosity evinced in such a manner as\
  \ to elude all tokens of gratitude, implied a sort of disdain for those on whom\
  \ the obligation was conferred, which in Cyrus Harding\u2019s eyes marred, in some\
  \ degree, the worth of the benefit.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us search,\u201D he resumed, \u201Cand God grant that we may some\
  \ day be permitted to prove to this haughty protector that he has not to deal with\
  \ ungrateful people! What would I not give could we repay him, by rendering him\
  \ in our turn, although at the price of our lives, some signal service!\u201D</p>"
- <p>From this day, the thoughts of the inhabitants of Lincoln Island were solely
  occupied with the intended search. Everything incited them to discover the answer
  to this enigma, an answer which would only be the name of a man endowed with a truly
  inexplicable, and in some degree superhuman power.</p>
- "<p>In a few minutes, the settlers re\u2011entered the house, where their influence\
  \ soon restored to Ayrton his moral and physical energy. Neb and Pencroft carried\
  \ the corpses of the convicts into the forest, some distance from the corral, and\
  \ buried them deep in the ground.</p>"
- "<p>Ayrton was then made acquainted with the facts which had occurred during his\
  \ seclusion. He learned Herbert\u2019s adventures, and through what various trials\
  \ the colonists had passed. As to the settlers, they had despaired of ever seeing\
  \ Ayrton again, and had been convinced that the convicts had ruthlessly murdered\
  \ him.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd now,\u201D said Cyrus Harding, as he ended his recital, \u201Ca duty\
  \ remains for us to perform. Half of our task is accomplished, but although the\
  \ convicts are no longer to be feared, it is not owing to ourselves that we are\
  \ once more masters of the island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell!\u201D answered Gideon Spilett, \u201Clet us search all this labyrinth\
  \ of the spurs of Mount Franklin. We will not leave a hollow, not a hole unexplored!\
  \ Ah! if ever a reporter found himself face to face with a mystery, it is I who\
  \ now speak to you, my friends!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd we will not return to Granite House until we have found our benefactor,\u201D\
  \ said Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D said the engineer, \u201Cwe will do all that it is humanly\
  \ possible to do, but I repeat we shall not find him until he himself permits us.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CShall we stay at the corral?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall stay here,\u201D answered Harding. \u201CProvisions are abundant,\
  \ and we are here in the very center of the circle we have to explore. Besides,\
  \ if necessary, the cart will take us rapidly to Granite House.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGood!\u201D answered the sailor. \u201COnly I have a remark to make.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat is it?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHere is the fine season getting on, and we must not forget that we have\
  \ a voyage to make.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA voyage?\u201D said Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, to Tabor Island,\u201D answered Pencroft. \u201CIt is necessary to\
  \ carry a notice there to point out the position of our island and say that Ayrton\
  \ is here in case the Scotch yacht should come to take him off. Who knows if it\
  \ is not already too late?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, Pencroft,\u201D asked Ayrton, \u201Chow do you intend to make this\
  \ voyage?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn the ?Bonadventure.\u201C</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe ?Bonadventure!\u201C exclaimed Ayrton. \u201CShe no longer exists.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy ?Bonadventure\u2019 exists no longer!\u201D shouted Pencroft, bounding\
  \ from his seat.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D answered Ayrton. \u201CThe convicts discovered her in her little\
  \ harbor only eight days ago, they put to sea in her?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd?\u201D said Pencroft, his heart beating.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd not having Bob Harvey to steer her, they ran on the rocks, and the\
  \ vessel went to pieces.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh, the villains, the cutthroats, the infamous scoundrels!\u201D exclaimed\
  \ Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPencroft,\u201D said Herbert, taking the sailor\u2019s hand, \u201Cwe\
  \ will build another ?Bonadventure\u2019?a larger one. We have all the ironwork?all\
  \ the rigging of the brig at our disposal.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut do you know,\u201D returned Pencroft, \u201Cthat it will take at least\
  \ five or six months to build a vessel of from thirty to forty tons?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe can take our time,\u201D said the reporter, \u201Cand we must give\
  \ up the voyage to Tabor Island for this year.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COh, my ?Bonadventure!\u2019 my poor ?Bonadventure!\u201C cried Pencroft,\
  \ almost broken\u2011hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he was so\
  \ proud.</p>"
- "<p>The loss of the \u201CBonadventure\u201D was certainly a thing to be lamented\
  \ by the colonists, and it was agreed that this loss should be repaired as soon\
  \ as possible. This settled, they now occupied themselves with bringing their researches\
  \ to bear on the most secret parts of the island.</p>"
- <p>The exploration was commenced at daybreak on the 19th of February, and lasted
  an entire week. The base of the mountain, with its spurs and their numberless ramifications,
  formed a labyrinth of valleys and elevations. It was evident that there, in the
  depths of these narrow gorges, perhaps even in the interior of Mount Franklin itself,
  was the proper place to pursue their researches. No part of the island could have
  been more suitable to conceal a dwelling whose occupant wished to remain unknown.
  But so irregular was the formation of the valleys that Cyrus Harding was obliged
  to conduct the exploration in a strictly methodical manner.</p>
- <p>The colonists first visited the valley opening to the south of the volcano, and
  which first received the waters of Falls River. There Ayrton showed them the cavern
  where the convicts had taken refuge, and in which he had been imprisoned until his
  removal to the corral. This cavern was just as Ayrton had left it. They found there
  a considerable quantity of ammunition and provisions, conveyed thither by the convicts
  in order to form a reserve.</p>
- <p>The whole of the valley bordering on the cave, shaded by fir and other trees,
  was thoroughly explored, and on turning the point of the southwestern spur, the
  colonists entered a narrower gorge similar to the picturesque columns of basalt
  on the coast. Here the trees were fewer. Stones took the place of grass. Goats and
  musmons gambolled among the rocks. Here began the barren part of the island. It
  could already be seen that, of the numerous valleys branching off at the base of
  Mount Franklin, three only were wooded and rich in pasturage like that of the corral,
  which bordered on the west on the Falls River valley, and on the east on the Red
  Creek valley. These two streams, which lower down became rivers by the absorption
  of several tributaries, were formed by all the springs of the mountain and thus
  caused the fertility of its southern part. As to the Mercy, it was more directly
  fed from ample springs concealed under the cover of Jacamar Wood, and it was by
  springs of this nature, spreading in a thousand streamlets, that the soil of the
  Serpentine Peninsula was watered.</p>
- "<p>Now, of these three well\u2011watered valleys, either might have served as a\
  \ retreat to some solitary who would have found there everything necessary for life.\
  \ But the settlers had already explored them, and in no part had they discovered\
  \ the presence of man.</p>"
- <p>Was it then in the depths of those barren gorges, in the midst of the piles of
  rock, in the rugged northern ravines, among the streams of lava, that this dwelling
  and its occupant would be found?</p>
- <p>The northern part of Mount Franklin was at its base composed solely of two valleys,
  wide, not very deep, without any appearance of vegetation, strewn with masses of
  rock, paved with lava, and varied with great blocks of mineral. This region required
  a long and careful exploration. It contained a thousand cavities, comfortless no
  doubt, but perfectly concealed and difficult of access.</p>
- <p>The colonists even visited dark tunnels, dating from the volcanic period, still
  black from the passage of the fire, and penetrated into the depths of the mountain.
  They traversed these somber galleries, waving lighted torches; they examined the
  smallest excavations; they sounded the shallowest depths, but all was dark and silent.
  It did not appear that the foot of man had ever before trodden these ancient passages,
  or that his arm had ever displaced one of these blocks, which remained as the volcano
  had cast them up above the waters, at the time of the submersion of the island.</p>
- <p>However, although these passages appeared to be absolutely deserted, and the
  obscurity was complete, Cyrus Harding was obliged to confess that absolute silence
  did not reign there.</p>
- <p>On arriving at the end of one of these gloomy caverns, extending several hundred
  feet into the interior of the mountain, he was surprised to hear a deep rumbling
  noise, increased in intensity by the sonorousness of the rocks.</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett, who accompanied him, also heard these distant mutterings, which
  indicated a revivification of the subterranean fires. Several times both listened,
  and they agreed that some chemical process was taking place in the bowels of the
  earth.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThen the volcano is not totally extinct?\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is possible that since our exploration of the crater,\u201D replied\
  \ Cyrus Harding, \u201Csome change has occurred. Any volcano, although considered\
  \ extinct, may evidently again burst forth.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut if an eruption of Mount Franklin occurred,\u201D asked Spilett, \u201C\
  would there not be some danger to Lincoln Island?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI do not think so,\u201D answered the reporter. \u201CThe crater, that\
  \ is to say, the safety\u2011valve, exists, and the overflow of smoke and lava,\
  \ would escape, as it did formerly, by this customary outlet.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CUnless the lava opened a new way for itself towards the fertile parts\
  \ of the island!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd why, my dear Spilett,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding, \u201Cshould it\
  \ not follow the road naturally traced out for it?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, volcanoes are capricious,\u201D returned the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNotice,\u201D answered the engineer, \u201Cthat the inclination of Mount\
  \ Franklin favors the flow of water towards the valleys which we are exploring just\
  \ now. To turn aside this flow, an earthquake would be necessary to change the mountain\u2019\
  s center of gravity.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut an earthquake is always to be feared at these times,\u201D observed\
  \ Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAlways,\u201D replied the engineer, \u201Cespecially when the subterranean\
  \ forces begin to awake, as they risk meeting with some obstruction, after a long\
  \ rest. Thus, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be a serious thing for us, and\
  \ it would be better that the volcano should not have the slightest desire to wake\
  \ up. But we could not prevent it, could we? At any rate, even if it should occur,\
  \ I do not think Prospect Heights would be seriously threatened. Between them and\
  \ the mountain, the ground is considerably depressed, and if the lava should ever\
  \ take a course towards the lake, it would be cast on the downs and the neighboring\
  \ parts of Shark Gulf.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe have not yet seen any smoke at the top of the mountain, to indicate\
  \ an approaching eruption,\u201D said Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo,\u201D answered Harding, \u201Cnot a vapor escapes from the crater,\
  \ for it was only yesterday that I attentively surveyed the summit. But it is probable\
  \ that at the lower part of the chimney, time may have accumulated rocks, cinders,\
  \ hardened lava, and that this valve of which I spoke, may at any time become overcharged.\
  \ But at the first serious effort, every obstacle will disappear, and you may be\
  \ certain, my dear Spilett, that neither the island, which is the boiler, nor the\
  \ volcano, which is the chimney, will burst under the pressure of gas. Nevertheless,\
  \ I repeat, it would be better that there should not be an eruption.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd yet we are not mistaken,\u201D remarked the reporter. \u201CMutterings\
  \ can be distinctly heard in the very bowels of the volcano!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are right,\u201D said the engineer, again listening attentively. \u201C\
  There can be no doubt of it. A commotion is going on there, of which we can neither\
  \ estimate the importance nor the ultimate result.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding and Spilett, on coming out, rejoined their companions, to whom
  they made known the state of affairs.</p>
- "<p>\u201CVery well!\u201D cried Pencroft, \u201CThe volcano wants to play his pranks!\
  \ Let him try, if he likes! He will find his master!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho?\u201D asked Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COur good genius, Neb, our good genius, who will shut his mouth for him,\
  \ if he so much as pretends to open it!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>As may be seen, the sailor\u2019s confidence in the tutelary deity of his island\
  \ was absolute, and, certainly, the occult power, manifested until now in so many\
  \ inexplicable ways, appeared to be unlimited; but also it knew how to escape the\
  \ colonists\u2019 most minute researches, for, in spite of all their efforts, in\
  \ spite of the more than zeal,?the obstinacy,?with which they carried on their exploration,\
  \ the retreat of the mysterious being could not be discovered.</p>"
- <p>From the 19th to the 20th of February the circle of investigation was extended
  to all the northern region of Lincoln Island, whose most secret nooks were explored.
  The colonists even went the length of tapping every rock. The search was extended
  to the extreme verge of the mountain. It was explored thus to the very summit of
  the truncated cone terminating the first row of rocks, then to the upper ridge of
  the enormous hat, at the bottom of which opened the crater.</p>
- <p>They did more; they visited the gulf, now extinct, but in whose depths the rumbling
  could be distinctly heard. However, no sign of smoke or vapor, no heating of the
  rock, indicated an approaching eruption. But neither there, nor in any other part
  of Mount Franklin, did the colonists find any traces of him of whom they were in
  search.</p>
- "<p>Their investigations were then directed to the downs. They carefully examined\
  \ the high lava\u2011cliffs of Shark Gulf from the base to the crest, although it\
  \ was extremely difficult to reach even the level of the gulf. No one!?nothing!</p>"
- <p>Indeed, in these three words was summed up so much fatigue uselessly expended,
  so much energy producing no results, that somewhat of anger mingled with the discomfiture
  of Cyrus Harding and his companions.</p>
- <p>It was now time to think of returning, for these researches could not be prolonged
  indefinitely. The colonists were certainly right in believing that the mysterious
  being did not reside on the surface of the island, and the wildest fancies haunted
  their excited imaginations. Pencroft and Neb, particularly, were not contented with
  the mystery, but allowed their imaginations to wander into the domain of the supernatural.</p>
- "<p>On the 25th of February the colonists re\u2011entered Granite House, and by\
  \ means of the double cord, carried by an arrow to the threshold of the door, they\
  \ re\u2011established communication between their habitation and the ground.</p>"
- <p>A month later they commemorated, on the 25th of March, the third anniversary
  of their arrival on Lincoln Island.</p>
- <p>Chapter 14</p>
- <p>Three years had passed away since the escape of the prisoners from Richmond,
  and how often during those three years had they spoken of their country, always
  present in their thoughts!</p>
- <p>They had no doubt that the civil war was at an end, and to them it appeared impossible
  that the just cause of the North had not triumphed. But what had been the incidents
  of this terrible war? How much blood had it not cost? How many of their friends
  must have fallen in the struggle? They often spoke of these things, without as yet
  being able to foresee the day when they would be permitted once more to see their
  country. To return thither, were it but for a few days, to renew the social link
  with the inhabited world, to establish a communication between their native land
  and their island, then to pass the longest, perhaps the best, portion of their existence
  in this colony, founded by them, and which would then be dependent on their country,
  was this a dream impossible to realize?</p>
- <p>There were only two ways of accomplishing it?either a ship must appear off Lincoln
  Island, or the colonists must themselves build a vessel strong enough to sail to
  the nearest land.</p>
- "<p>\u201CUnless,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cour good genius, himself provides us\
  \ with the means of returning to our country.\u201D</p>"
- <p>And, really, had any one told Pencroft and Neb that a ship of 300 tons was waiting
  for them in Shark Gulf or at Port Balloon, they would not even have made a gesture
  of surprise. In their state of mind nothing appeared improbable.</p>
- "<p>But Cyrus Harding, less confident, advised them to confine themselves to fact,\
  \ and more especially so with regard to the building of a vessel?a really urgent\
  \ work, since it was for the purpose of depositing, as soon as possible, at Tabor\
  \ Island a document indicating Ayrton\u2019s new residence.</p>"
- "<p>As the \u201CBonadventure\u201D no longer existed, six months at least would\
  \ be required for the construction of a new vessel. Now winter was approaching,\
  \ and the voyage would not be made before the following spring.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe have time to get everything ready for the fine season,\u201D remarked\
  \ the engineer, who was consulting with Pencroft about these matters. \u201CI think,\
  \ therefore, my friend, that since we have to rebuild our vessel it will be best\
  \ to give her larger dimensions. The arrival of the Scotch yacht at Tabor Island\
  \ is very uncertain. It may even be that, having arrived several months ago, she\
  \ has again sailed after having vainly searched for some trace of Ayrton. Will it\
  \ not then be best to build a ship which, if necessary, could take us either to\
  \ the Polynesian Archipelago or to New Zealand? What do you think?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI think, captain,\u201D answered the sailor; \u201CI think that you are\
  \ as capable of building a large vessel as a small one. Neither the wood nor the\
  \ tools are wanting. It is only a question of time.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd how many months would be required to build a vessel of from 250 to\
  \ 300 tons?\u201D asked Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSeven or eight months at least,\u201D replied Pencroft. \u201CBut it must\
  \ not be forgotten that winter is drawing near, and that in severe frost wood is\
  \ difficult to work. We must calculate on several weeks delay, and if our vessel\
  \ is ready by next November we may think ourselves very lucky.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cthat will be exactly the most\
  \ favorable time for undertaking a voyage of any importance, either to Tabor Island\
  \ or to a more distant land.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CSo it will, captain,\u201D answered the sailor. \u201CMake out your plans\
  \ then; the workmen are ready, and I imagine that Ayrton can lend us a good helping\
  \ hand.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The colonists, having been consulted, approved the engineer\u2019s plan, and\
  \ it was, indeed, the best thing to be done. It is true that the construction of\
  \ a ship of from two to three hundred tons would be great labor, but the colonists\
  \ had confidence in themselves, justified by their previous success.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding then busied himself in drawing the plan of the vessel and making
  the model. During this time his companions employed themselves in felling and carting
  trees to furnish the ribs, timbers, and planks. The forest of the Far West supplied
  the best oaks and elms. They took advantage of the opening already made on their
  last excursion to form a practicable road, which they named the Far West Road, and
  the trees were carried to the Chimneys, where the dockyard was established. As to
  the road in question, the choice of trees had rendered its direction somewhat capricious,
  but at the same time it facilitated the access to a large part of the Serpentine
  Peninsula.</p>
- <p>It was important that the trees should be quickly felled and cut up, for they
  could not be used while yet green, and some time was necessary to allow them to
  get seasoned. The carpenters, therefore, worked vigorously during the month of April,
  which was troubled only by a few equinoctial gales of some violence. Master Jup
  aided them dexterously, either by climbing to the top of a tree to fasten the ropes
  or by lending his stout shoulders to carry the lopped trunks.</p>
- <p>All this timber was piled up under a large shed, built near the Chimneys, and
  there awaited the time for use.</p>
- "<p>The month of April was tolerably fine, as October often is in the northern zone.\
  \ At the same time other work was actively continued, and soon all trace of devastation\
  \ disappeared from the plateau of Prospect Heights. The mill was rebuilt, and new\
  \ buildings rose in the poultry\u2011yard. It had appeared necessary to enlarge\
  \ their dimensions, for the feathered population had increased considerably. The\
  \ stable now contained five onagers, four of which were well broken, and allowed\
  \ themselves to be either driven or ridden, and a little colt. The colony now possessed\
  \ a plow, to which the onagers were yoked like regular Yorkshire or Kentucky oxen.\
  \ The colonists divided their work, and their arms never tired. Then who could have\
  \ enjoyed better health than these workers, and what good humor enlivened the evenings\
  \ in Granite House as they formed a thousand plans for the future!</p>"
- <p>As a matter of course Ayrton shared the common lot in every respect, and there
  was no longer any talk of his going to live at the corral. Nevertheless he was still
  sad and reserved, and joined more in the work than in the pleasures of his companions.
  But he was a valuable workman at need?strong, skilful, ingenious, intelligent. He
  was esteemed and loved by all, and he could not be ignorant of it.</p>
- "<p>In the meanwhile the corral was not abandoned. Every other day one of the settlers,\
  \ driving the cart or mounted on an onager, went to look after the flock of musmons\
  \ and goats and bring back the supply of milk required by Neb. These excursions\
  \ at the same time afforded opportunities for hunting. Therefore Herbert and Gideon\
  \ Spilett, with Top in front, traversed more often than their companions the road\
  \ to the corral, and with the capital guns which they carried, capybaras, agouties,\
  \ kangaroos, and wild pigs for large game, ducks, grouse, jacamars, and snipe for\
  \ small game, were never wanting in the house. The produce of the warren, of the\
  \ oyster\u2011bed, several turtles which were taken, excellent salmon which came\
  \ up the Mercy, vegetables from the plateau, wild fruit from the forest, were riches\
  \ upon riches, and Neb, the head cook, could scarcely by himself store them away.</p>"
- <p>The telegraphic wire between the corral and Granite House had of course been
  repaired, and it was worked whenever one or other of the settlers was at the corral
  and found it necessary to spend the night there. Besides, the island was safe now
  and no attacks were to be feared, at any rate from men.</p>
- <p>However, that which had happened might happen again. A descent of pirates, or
  even of escaped convicts, was always to be feared. It was possible that companions
  or accomplices of Bob Harvey had been in the secret of his plans, and might be tempted
  to imitate him. The colonists, therefore, were careful to observe the sea around
  the island, and every day their telescope covered the horizon enclosed by Union
  and Washington Bays. When they went to the corral they examined the sea to the west
  with no less attention, and by climbing the spur their gaze extended over a large
  section of the western horizon.</p>
- <p>Nothing suspicious was discerned, but still it was necessary for them to be on
  their guard.</p>
- <p>The engineer one evening imparted to his friends a plan which he had conceived
  for fortifying the corral. It appeared prudent to him to heighten the palisade and
  to flank it with a sort of blockhouse, which, if necessary, the settlers could hold
  against the enemy. Granite House might, by its very position, be considered impregnable;
  therefore the corral with its buildings, its stores, and the animals it contained,
  would always be the object of pirates, whoever they were, who might land on the
  island, and should the colonists be obliged to shut themselves up there they ought
  also to be able to defend themselves without any disadvantage. This was a project
  which might be left for consideration, and they were, besides, obliged to put off
  its execution until the next spring.</p>
- "<p>About the 15th of May the keel of the new vessel lay along the dockyard, and\
  \ soon the stem and stern\u2011post, mortised at each of its extremities, rose almost\
  \ perpendicularly. The keel, of good oak, measured 110 feet in length, this allowing\
  \ a width of five\u2011and\u2011twenty feet to the midship beam. But this was all\
  \ the carpenters could do before the arrival of the frosts and bad weather. During\
  \ the following week they fixed the first of the stern timbers, but were then obliged\
  \ to suspend work.</p>"
- <p>During the last days of the month the weather was extremely bad. The wind blew
  from the east, sometimes with the violence of a tempest. The engineer was somewhat
  uneasy on account of the dockyard shed?which besides, he could not have established
  in any other place near to Granite House?for the islet only imperfectly sheltered
  the shore from the fury of the open sea, and in great storms the waves beat against
  the very foot of the granite cliff.</p>
- <p>But, very fortunately, these fears were not realized. The wind shifted to the
  southeast, and there the beach of Granite House was completely covered by Flotsam
  Point.</p>
- <p>Pencroft and Ayrton, the most zealous workmen at the new vessel, pursued their
  labor as long as they could. They were not men to mind the wind tearing at their
  hair, nor the rain wetting them to the skin, and a blow from a hammer is worth just
  as much in bad as in fine weather. But when a severe frost succeeded this wet period,
  the wood, its fibers acquiring the hardness of iron, became extremely difficult
  to work, and about the 10th of June shipbuilding was obliged to be entirely discontinued.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions had not omitted to observe how severe was the
  temperature during the winters of Lincoln Island. The cold was comparable to that
  experienced in the States of New England, situated at almost the same distance from
  the equator. In the northern hemisphere, or at any rate in the part occupied by
  British America and the north of the United States, this phenomenon is explained
  by the flat conformation of the territories bordering on the pole, and on which
  there is no intumescence of the soil to oppose any obstacle to the north winds;
  here, in Lincoln Island, this explanation would not suffice.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt has even been observed,\u201D remarked Harding one day to his companions,\
  \ \u201Cthat in equal latitudes the islands and coast regions are less tried by\
  \ the cold than inland countries. I have often heard it asserted that the winters\
  \ of Lombardy, for example, are not less rigorous than those of Scotland, which\
  \ results from the sea restoring during the winter the heat which it received during\
  \ the summer. Islands are, therefore, in a better situation for benefiting by this\
  \ restitution.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut then, Captain Harding,\u201D asked Herbert, \u201Cwhy does Lincoln\
  \ Island appear to escape the common law?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is difficult to explain,\u201D answered the engineer. \u201CHowever,\
  \ I should be disposed to conjecture that this peculiarity results from the situation\
  \ of the island in the Southern Hemisphere, which, as you know, my boy, is colder\
  \ than the Northern Hemisphere.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D said Herbert, \u201Cand icebergs are met with in lower latitudes\
  \ in the south than in the north of the Pacific.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is true,\u201D remarked Pencroft, \u201Cand when I have been serving\
  \ on board whalers I have seen icebergs off Cape Horn.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe severe cold experienced in Lincoln Island,\u201D said Gideon Spilett,\
  \ \u201Cmay then perhaps be explained by the presence of floes or icebergs comparatively\
  \ near to Lincoln Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYour opinion is very admissible indeed, my dear Spilett,\u201D answered\
  \ Cyrus Harding, \u201Cand it is evidently to the proximity of icebergs that we\
  \ owe our rigorous winters. I would draw your attention also to an entirely physical\
  \ cause, which renders the Southern colder than the Northern Hemisphere. In fact,\
  \ since the sun is nearer to this hemisphere during the summer, it is necessarily\
  \ more distant during the winter. This explains then the excess of temperature in\
  \ the two seasons, for, if we find the winters very cold in Lincoln Island, we must\
  \ not forget that the summers here, on the contrary, are very hot.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut why, if you please, captain,\u201D asked Pencroft, knitting his brows,\
  \ \u201Cwhy should our hemisphere, as you say, be so badly divided? It isn\u2019\
  t just, that!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFriend Pencroft,\u201D answered the engineer, laughing, \u201Cwhether\
  \ just or not, we must submit to it, and here lies the reason for this peculiarity.\
  \ The earth does not describe a circle around the sun, but an ellipse, as it must\
  \ by the laws of rational mechanics. Now, the earth occupies one of the foci of\
  \ the ellipse, and so at one point in its course is at its apogee, that is, at its\
  \ farthest from the sun, and at another point it is at its perigee, or nearest to\
  \ the sun. Now it happens that it is during the winter of the southern countries\
  \ that it is at its most distant point from the sun, and consequently, in a situation\
  \ for those regions to feel the greatest cold. Nothing can be done to prevent that,\
  \ and men, Pencroft, however learned they may be, can never change anything of the\
  \ cosmographical order established by God Himself.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd yet,\u201D added Pencroft, \u201Cthe world is very learned. What a\
  \ big book, captain, might be made with all that is known!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd what a much bigger book still with all that is not known!\u201D answered\
  \ Harding.</p>"
- <p>At last, for one reason or another, the month of June brought the cold with its
  accustomed intensity, and the settlers were often confined to Granite House. Ah!
  how wearisome this imprisonment was to them, and more particularly to Gideon Spilett.</p>
- "<p>\u201CLook here,\u201D said he to Neb one day, \u201CI would give you by notarial\
  \ deed all the estates which will come to me some day, if you were a good enough\
  \ fellow to go, no matter where, and subscribe to some newspaper for me! Decidedly\
  \ the thing that is most essential to my happiness is the knowing every morning\
  \ what has happened the day before in other places than this!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Neb began to laugh.</p>
- "<p>\u201C?Pon my word,\u201D he replied, \u201Cthe only thing I think about is\
  \ my daily work!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The truth was that indoors as well as out there was no want of work.</p>
- <p>The colony of Lincoln Island was now at its highest point of prosperity, achieved
  by three years of continued hard work. The destruction of the brig had been a new
  source of riches. Without speaking of the complete rig which would serve for the
  vessel now on the stocks, utensils and tools of all sorts, weapons and ammunition,
  clothes and instruments, were now piled in the storerooms of Granite House. It had
  not even been necessary to resort again to the manufacture of the coarse felt materials.
  Though the colonists had suffered from cold during their first winter, the bad season
  might now come without their having any reason to dread its severity. Linen was
  plentiful also, and besides, they kept it with extreme care. From chloride of sodium,
  which is nothing else than sea salt, Cyrus Harding easily extracted the soda and
  chlorine. The soda, which it was easy to change into carbonate of soda, and the
  chlorine, of which he made chloride of lime, were employed for various domestic
  purposes, and especially in bleaching linen. Besides, they did not wash more than
  four times a year, as was done by families in the olden times, and it may be added,
  that Pencroft and Gideon Spilett, while waiting for the postman to bring him his
  newspaper, distinguished themselves as washermen.</p>
- "<p>So passed the winter months, June, July, and August. They were severe, and the\
  \ average observations of the thermometer did not give more than eight degrees of\
  \ Fahrenheit. It was therefore lower in temperature than the preceding winter. But\
  \ then, what splendid fires blazed continually on the hearths of Granite House,\
  \ the smoke marking the granite wall with long, zebra\u2011like streaks! Fuel was\
  \ not spared, as it grew naturally a few steps from them. Besides, the chips of\
  \ the wood destined for the construction of the ship enabled them to economize the\
  \ coal, which required more trouble to transport.</p>"
- "<p>Men and animals were all well. Master Jup was a little chilly, it must be confessed.\
  \ This was perhaps his only weakness, and it was necessary to make him a well\u2011\
  padded dressing\u2011gown. But what a servant he was, clever, zealous, indefatigable,\
  \ not indiscreet, not talkative, and he might have been with reason proposed as\
  \ a model for all his biped brothers in the Old and New Worlds!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAs for that,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cwhen one has four hands at one\u2019\
  s service, of course one\u2019s work ought to be done so much the better!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>And indeed the intelligent creature did it well.</p>
- <p>During the seven months which had passed since the last researches made round
  the mountain, and during the month of September, which brought back fine weather,
  nothing was heard of the genius of the island. His power was not manifested in any
  way. It is true that it would have been superfluous, for no incident occurred to
  put the colonists to any painful trial.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding even observed that if by chance the communication between the\
  \ unknown and the tenants of Granite House had ever been established through the\
  \ granite, and if Top\u2019s instinct had as it were felt it, there was no further\
  \ sign of it during this period. The dog\u2019s growling had entirely ceased, as\
  \ well as the uneasiness of the orang. The two friends?for they were such?no longer\
  \ prowled round the opening of the inner well, nor did they bark or whine in that\
  \ singular way which from the first the engineer had noticed. But could he be sure\
  \ that this was all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never\
  \ arrive at a solution? Could he be certain that some conjuncture would not occur\
  \ which would bring the mysterious personage on the scene? who could tell what the\
  \ future might have in reserve?</p>"
- <p>At last the winter was ended, but an event, the consequences of which might be
  serious occurred in the first days of the returning spring.</p>
- <p>On the 7th of September, Cyrus Harding, having observed the crater, saw smoke
  curling round the summit of the mountain, its first vapors rising in the air.</p>
- <p>Chapter 15</p>
- <p>The colonists, warned by the engineer, left their work and gazed in silence at
  the summit of Mount Franklin.</p>
- <p>The volcano had awoke, and the vapor had penetrated the mineral layer heaped
  at the bottom of the crater. But would the subterranean fires provoke any violent
  eruption? This was an event which could not be foreseen. However, even while admitting
  the possibility of an eruption, it was not probable that the whole of Lincoln Island
  would suffer from it. The flow of volcanic matter is not always disastrous, and
  the island had already undergone this trial, as was shown by the streams of lava
  hardened on the northern slopes of the mountain. Besides, from the shape of the
  crater?the opening broken in the upper edge?the matter would be thrown to the side
  opposite the fertile regions of the island.</p>
- <p>However, the past did not necessarily answer for the future. Often, at the summit
  of volcanoes, the old craters close and new ones open. This had occurred in the
  two hemispheres?at Etna, Popocatepetl, at Orizabaand on the eve of an eruption there
  is everything to be feared. In fact, an earthquake?a phenomenon which often accompanies
  volcanic eruption?is enough to change the interior arrangement of a mountain, and
  to open new outlets for the burning lava.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding explained these things to his companions, and, without exaggerating
  the state of things, he told them all the pros and cons. After all, they could not
  prevent it. It did not appear likely that Granite House would be threatened unless
  the ground was shaken by an earthquake. But the corral would be in great danger
  should a new crater open in the southern side of Mount Franklin.</p>
- <p>From that day the smoke never disappeared from the top of the mountain, and it
  could even be perceived that it increased in height and thickness, without any flame
  mingling in its heavy volumes. The phenomenon was still concentrated in the lower
  part of the central crater.</p>
- "<p>However, with the fine days work had been continued. The building of the vessel\
  \ was hastened as much as possible, and, by means of the waterfall on the shore,\
  \ Cyrus Harding managed to establish an hydraulic sawmill, which rapidly cut up\
  \ the trunks of trees into planks and joists. The mechanism of this apparatus was\
  \ as simple as those used in the rustic sawmills of Norway. A first horizontal movement\
  \ to move the piece of wood, a second vertical movement to move the saw?this was\
  \ all that was wanted; and the engineer succeeded by means of a wheel, two cylinders,\
  \ and pulleys properly arranged. Towards the end of the month of September the skeleton\
  \ of the vessel, which was to be rigged as a schooner, lay in the dockyard. The\
  \ ribs were almost entirely completed, and, all the timbers having been sustained\
  \ by a provisional band, the shape of the vessel could already be seen. The schooner,\
  \ sharp in the bows, very slender in the after\u2011part, would evidently be suitable\
  \ for a long voyage, if wanted; but laying the planking would still take a considerable\
  \ time. Very fortunately, the iron work of the pirate brig had been saved after\
  \ the explosion. From the planks and injured ribs Pencroft and Ayrton had extracted\
  \ the bolts and a large quantity of copper nails. It was so much work saved for\
  \ the smiths, but the carpenters had much to do.</p>"
- "<p>Shipbuilding was interrupted for a week for the harvest, the haymaking, and\
  \ the gathering in of the different crops on the plateau. This work finished, every\
  \ moment was devoted to finishing the schooner. When night came the workmen were\
  \ really quite exhausted. So as not to lose any time they had changed the hours\
  \ for their meals; they dined at twelve o\u2019clock, and only had their supper\
  \ when daylight failed them. They then ascended to Granite House, when they were\
  \ always ready to go to bed.</p>"
- <p>Sometimes, however, when the conversation bore on some interesting subject the
  hour for sleep was delayed for a time. The colonists then spoke of the future, and
  talked willingly of the changes which a voyage in the schooner to inhabited lands
  would make in their situation. But always, in the midst of these plans, prevailed
  the thought of a subsequent return to Lincoln Island. Never would they abandon this
  colony, founded with so much labor and with such success, and to which a communication
  with America would afford a fresh impetus. Pencroft and Neb especially hoped to
  end their days there.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHerbert,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cyou will never abandon Lincoln Island?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNever, Pencroft, and especially if you make up your mind to stay there.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat was made up long ago, my boy,\u201D answered Pencroft. \u201CI shall\
  \ expect you. You will bring me your wife and children, and I shall make jolly chaps\
  \ of your youngsters!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat\u2019s agreed,\u201D replied Herbert, laughing and blushing at the\
  \ same time.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd you, Captain Harding,\u201D resumed Pencroft enthusiastically, \u201C\
  you will be still the governor of the island! Ah, how many inhabitants could it\
  \ support? Ten thousand at least!\u201D</p>"
- <p>They talked in this way, allowing Pencroft to run on, and at last the reporter
  actually started a newspaper?the New Lincoln Herald!</p>
- "<p>So is man\u2019s heart. The desire to perform a work which will endure, which\
  \ will survive him, is the origin of his superiority over all other living creatures\
  \ here below. It is this which has established his dominion, and this it is which\
  \ justifies it, over all the world.</p>"
- <p>After that, who knows if Jup and Top had not themselves their little dream of
  the future.</p>
- <p>Ayrton silently said to himself that he would like to see Lord Glenarvan again
  and show himself to all restored.</p>
- "<p>One evening, on the 15th of October, the conversation was prolonged later than\
  \ usual. It was nine o\u2019clock. Already, long badly concealed yawns gave warning\
  \ of the hour of rest, and Pencroft was proceeding towards his bed, when the electric\
  \ bell, placed in the dining\u2011room, suddenly rang.</p>"
- <p>All were there, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Ayrton, Pencroft, Neb.
  Therefore none of the colonists were at the corral.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding rose. His companions stared at each other, scarcely believing their
  ears.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat does that mean?\u201D cried Neb. \u201CWas it the devil who rang\
  \ it?\u201D</p>"
- <p>No one answered.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe weather is stormy,\u201D observed Herbert. \u201CMight not its influence\
  \ of electricity?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Herbert did not finish his phrase. The engineer, towards whom all eyes were turned,
  shook his head negatively.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe must wait,\u201D said Gideon Spilett. \u201CIf it is a signal, whoever\
  \ it may be who has made it, he will renew it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut who do you think it is?\u201D cried Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho?\u201D answered Pencroft, \u201Cbut he?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The sailor\u2019s sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the bell.</p>"
- <p>Harding went to the apparatus, and sent this question to the corral:?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat do you want?\u201D</p>"
- <p>A few moments later the needle, moving on the alphabetic dial, gave this reply
  to the tenants of Granite House:?</p>
- "<p>\u201CCome to the corral immediately.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt last!\u201D exclaimed Harding.</p>"
- "<p>Yes! At last! The mystery was about to be unveiled. The colonists\u2019 fatigue\
  \ had disappeared before the tremendous interest which was about to urge them to\
  \ the corral, and all wish for rest had ceased. Without having uttered a word, in\
  \ a few moments they had left Granite House, and were standing on the beach. Jup\
  \ and Top alone were left behind. They could do without them.</p>"
- <p>The night was black. The new moon had disappeared at the same time as the sun.
  As Herbert had observed, great stormy clouds formed a lowering and heavy vault,
  preventing any star rays. A few lightning flashes, reflections from a distant storm,
  illuminated the horizon.</p>
- <p>It was possible that a few hours later the thunder would roll over the island
  itself. The night was very threatening.</p>
- <p>But however deep the darkness was, it would not prevent them from finding the
  familiar road to the corral.</p>
- <p>They ascended the left bank of the Mercy, reached the plateau, passed the bridge
  over Creek Glycerine, and advanced through the forest.</p>
- "<p>They walked at a good pace, a prey to the liveliest emotions. There was no doubt\
  \ but that they were now going to learn the long\u2011searched\u2011for answer to\
  \ the enigma, the name of that mysterious being, so deeply concerned in their life,\
  \ so generous in his influence, so powerful in his action! Must not this stranger\
  \ have indeed mingled with their existence, have known the smallest details, have\
  \ heard all that was said in Granite House, to have been able always to act in the\
  \ very nick of time?</p>"
- <p>Every one, wrapped up in his own reflections, pressed forward. Under the arch
  of trees the darkness was such that even the edge of the road could not be seen.
  Not a sound in the forest. Both animals and birds, influenced by the heaviness of
  the atmosphere, remained motionless and silent. Not a breath disturbed the leaves.
  The footsteps of the colonists alone resounded on the hardened ground.</p>
- <p>During the first quarter of an hour the silence was only interrupted by this
  remark from Pencroft:?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe ought to have brought a torch.\u201D</p>"
- <p>And by this reply from the engineer:?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe shall find one at the corral.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Harding and his companions had left Granite House at twelve minutes past nine.\
  \ At forty\u2011seven minutes past nine they had traversed three out of the five\
  \ miles which separated the mouth of the Mercy from the corral.</p>"
- <p>At that moment sheets of lightning spread over the island and illumined the dark
  trees. The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them. Evidently the storm would not
  be long in bursting forth.</p>
- <p>The flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid. Distant thunder growled
  in the sky. The atmosphere was stifling.</p>
- <p>The colonists proceeded as if they were urged onwards by some irresistible force.</p>
- "<p>At ten o\u2019clock a vivid flash showed them the palisade, and as they reached\
  \ the gate the storm burst forth with tremendous fury.</p>"
- <p>In a minute the corral was crossed, and Harding stood before the hut.</p>
- <p>Probably the house was occupied by the stranger, since it was from thence that
  the telegram had been sent. However, no light shone through the window.</p>
- <p>The engineer knocked at the door.</p>
- <p>No answer.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding opened the door, and the settlers entered the room, which was perfectly
  dark. A light was struck by Neb, and in a few moments the lantern was lighted and
  the light thrown into every corner of the room.</p>
- <p>There was no one there. Everything was in the state in which it had been left.</p>
- "<p>\u201CHave we been deceived by an illusion?\u201D murmured Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- <p>No! that was not possible! The telegram had clearly said,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CCome to the corral immediately.\u201D</p>"
- <p>They approached the table specially devoted to the use of the wire. Everything
  was in order?the pile on the box containing it, as well as all the apparatus.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWho came here the last time?\u201D asked the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI did, captain,\u201D answered Ayrton.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd that was?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CFour days ago.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh! a note!\u201D cried Herbert, pointing to a paper lying on the table.</p>"
- <p>On this paper were written these words in English:?</p>
- "<p>\u201CFollow the new wire.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CForward!\u201D cried Harding, who understood that the despatch had not\
  \ been sent from the corral, but from the mysterious retreat, communicating directly\
  \ with Granite House by means of a supplementary wire joined to the old one.</p>"
- "<p>Neb took the lighted lantern, and all left the corral. The storm then burst\
  \ forth with tremendous violence. The interval between each lightning\u2011flash\
  \ and each thunder\u2011clap diminished rapidly. The summit of the volcano, with\
  \ its plume of vapor, could be seen by occasional flashes.</p>"
- <p>There was no telegraphic communication in any part of the corral between the
  house and the palisade; but the engineer, running straight to the first post, saw
  by the light of a flash a new wire hanging from the isolator to the ground.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThere it is!\u201D said he.</p>"
- <p>This wire lay along the ground, and was surrounded with an isolating substance
  like a submarine cable, so as to assure the free transmission of the current. It
  appeared to pass through the wood and the southern spurs of the mountain, and consequently
  it ran towards the west.</p>
- "<p>\u201CFollow it!\u201D said Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- <p>And the settlers immediately pressed forward, guided by the wire.</p>
- <p>The thunder continued to roar with such violence that not a word could be heard.
  However, there was no occasion for speaking, but to get forward as fast as possible.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding and his companions then climbed the spur rising between the corral\
  \ valley and that of Falls River, which they crossed at its narrowest part. The\
  \ wire, sometimes stretched over the lower branches of the trees, sometimes lying\
  \ on the ground, guided them surely. The engineer had supposed that the wire would\
  \ perhaps stop at the bottom of the valley, and that the stranger\u2019s retreat\
  \ would be there.</p>"
- "<p>Nothing of the sort. They were obliged to ascend the south\u2011western spur,\
  \ and re\u2011descend on that arid plateau terminated by the strangely\u2011wild\
  \ basalt cliff. From time to time one of the colonists stooped down and felt for\
  \ the wire with his hands; but there was now no doubt that the wire was running\
  \ directly towards the sea. There, to a certainty, in the depths of those rocks,\
  \ was the dwelling so long sought for in vain.</p>"
- <p>The sky was literally on fire. Flash succeeded flash. Several struck the summit
  of the volcano in the midst of the thick smoke. It appeared there as if the mountain
  was vomiting flame. At a few minutes to eleven the colonists arrived on the high
  cliff overlooking the ocean to the west. The wind had risen. The surf roared 500
  feet below.</p>
- <p>Harding calculated that they had gone a mile and a half from the corral.</p>
- "<p>At this point the wire entered among the rocks, following the steep side of\
  \ a narrow ravine. The settlers followed it at the risk of occasioning a fall of\
  \ the slightly\u2011balanced rocks, and being dashed into the sea. The descent was\
  \ extremely perilous, but they did not think of the danger; they were no longer\
  \ masters of themselves, and an irresistible attraction drew them towards this mysterious\
  \ place as the magnet draws iron.</p>"
- <p>Thus they almost unconsciously descended this ravine, which even in broad daylight
  would have been considered impracticable.</p>
- <p>The stones rolled and sparkled like fiery balls when they crossed through the
  gleams of light. Harding was first?Ayrton last. On they went, step by step. Now
  they slid over the slippery rock; then they struggled to their feet and scrambled
  on.</p>
- <p>At last the wire touched the rocks on the beach. The colonists had reached the
  bottom of the basalt cliff.</p>
- <p>There appeared a narrow ridge, running horizontally and parallel with the sea.
  The settlers followed the wire along it. They had not gone a hundred paces when
  the ridge by a moderate incline sloped down to the level of the sea.</p>
- <p>The engineer seized the wire and found that it disappeared beneath the waves.</p>
- <p>His companions were stupefied.</p>
- <p>A cry of disappointment, almost a cry of despair, escaped them! Must they then
  plunge beneath the water and seek there for some submarine cavern? In their excited
  state they would not have hesitated to do it.</p>
- <p>The engineer stopped them.</p>
- <p>He led his companions to a hollow in the rocks, and there?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe must wait,\u201D said he. \u201CThe tide is high. At low water the\
  \ way will be open.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut what can make you think\u2011\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe would not have called us if the means had been wanting to enable us\
  \ to reach him!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding spoke in a tone of such thorough conviction that no objection was
  raised. His remark, besides, was logical. It was quite possible that an opening,
  practicable at low water, though hidden now by the high tide, opened at the foot
  of the cliff.</p>
- "<p>There was some time to wait. The colonists remained silently crouching in a\
  \ deep hollow. Rain now began to fall in torrents. The thunder was re\u2011echoed\
  \ among the rocks with a grand sonorousness.</p>"
- "<p>The colonists\u2019 emotion was great. A thousand strange and extraordinary\
  \ ideas crossed their brains, and they expected some grand and superhuman apparition,\
  \ which alone could come up to the notion they had formed of the mysterious genius\
  \ of the island.</p>"
- <p>At midnight, Harding carrying the lantern, descended to the beach to reconnoiter.</p>
- <p>The engineer was not mistaken. The beginning of an immense excavation could be
  seen under the water. There the wire, bending at a right angle, entered the yawning
  gulf.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding returned to his companions, and said simply,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CIn an hour the opening will be practicable.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is there, then?\u201D said Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDid you doubt it?\u201D returned Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut this cavern must be filled with water to a certain height,\u201D observed\
  \ Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CEither the cavern will be completely dry,\u201D replied Harding, \u201C\
  and in that case we can traverse it on foot, or it will not be dry, and some means\
  \ of transport will be put at our disposal.\u201D</p>"
- <p>An hour passed. All climbed down through the rain to the level of the sea. There
  was now eight feet of the opening above the water. It was like the arch of a bridge,
  under which rushed the foaming water.</p>
- "<p>Leaning forward, the engineer saw a black object floating on the water. He drew\
  \ it towards him. It was a boat, moored to some interior projection of the cave.\
  \ This boat was iron\u2011plated. Two oars lay at the bottom.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CJump in!\u201D said Harding.</p>"
- <p>In a moment the settlers were in the boat. Neb and Ayrton took the oars, Pencroft
  the rudder. Cyrus Harding in the bows, with the lantern, lighted the way.</p>
- <p>The elliptical roof, under which the boat at first passed, suddenly rose; but
  the darkness was too deep, and the light of the lantern too slight, for either the
  extent, length, height, or depth of the cave to be ascertained. Solemn silence reigned
  in this basaltic cavern. Not a sound could penetrate into it, even the thunder peals
  could not pierce its thick sides.</p>
- "<p>Such immense caves exist in various parts of the world, natural crypts dating\
  \ from the geological epoch of the globe. Some are filled by the sea; others contain\
  \ entire lakes in their sides. Such is Fingal\u2019s Cave, in the island of Staffa,\
  \ one of the Hebrides; such are the caves of Morgat, in the bay of Douarnenez, in\
  \ Brittany, the caves of Bonifacio, in Corsica, those of Lyse\u2011Fjord, in Norway;\
  \ such are the immense Mammoth caverns in Kentucky, 500 feet in height, and more\
  \ than twenty miles in length! In many parts of the globe, nature has excavated\
  \ these caverns, and preserved them for the admiration of man.</p>"
- <p>Did the cavern which the settlers were now exploring extend to the center of
  the island? For a quarter of an hour the boat had been advancing, making detours,
  indicated to Pencroft by the engineer in short sentences, when all at once,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CMore to the right!\u201D he commanded.</p>"
- <p>The boat, altering its course, came up alongside the right wall. The engineer
  wished to see if the wire still ran along the side.</p>
- <p>The wire was there fastened to the rock.</p>
- "<p>\u201CForward!\u201D said Harding.</p>"
- <p>And the two oars, plunging into the dark waters, urged the boat onwards.</p>
- "<p>On they went for another quarter of an hour, and a distance of half\u2011a\u2011\
  mile must have been cleared from the mouth of the cave, when Harding\u2019s voice\
  \ was again heard.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CStop!\u201D said he.</p>"
- <p>The boat stopped, and the colonists perceived a bright light illuminating the
  vast cavern, so deeply excavated in the bowels of the island, of which nothing had
  ever led them to suspect the existence.</p>
- <p>At a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof, supported on basalt shafts.
  Irregular arches, strange moldings, appeared on the columns erected by nature in
  thousands from the first epochs of the formation of the globe. The basalt pillars,
  fitted one into the other, measured from forty to fifty feet in height, and the
  water, calm in spite of the tumult outside, washed their base. The brilliant focus
  of light, pointed out by the engineer, touched every point of rocks, and flooded
  the walls with light.</p>
- <p>By reflection the water reproduced the brilliant sparkles, so that the boat appeared
  to be floating between two glittering zones. They could not be mistaken in the nature
  of the irradiation thrown from the glowing nucleus, whose clear rays were shattered
  by all the angles, all the projections of the cavern. This light proceeded from
  an electric source, and its white color betrayed its origin. It was the sun of this
  cave, and it filled it entirely.</p>
- "<p>At a sign from Cyrus Harding the oars again plunged into the water, causing\
  \ a regular shower of gems, and the boat was urged forward towards the light, which\
  \ was now not more than half a cable\u2019s length distant.</p>"
- <p>At this place the breadth of the sheet of water measured nearly 350 feet, and
  beyond the dazzling center could be seen an enormous basaltic wall, blocking up
  any issue on that side. The cavern widened here considerably, the sea forming a
  little lake. But the roof, the side walls, the end cliff, all the prisms, all the
  peaks, were flooded with the electric fluid, so that the brilliancy belonged to
  them, and as if the light issued from them.</p>
- "<p>In the center of the lake a long cigar\u2011shaped object floated on the surface\
  \ of the water, silent, motionless. The brilliancy which issued from it escaped\
  \ from its sides as from two kilns heated to a white heat. This apparatus, similar\
  \ in shape to an enormous whale, was about 250 feet long, and rose about ten or\
  \ twelve above the water.</p>"
- "<p>The boat slowly approached it, Cyrus Harding stood up in the bows. He gazed,\
  \ a prey to violent excitement. Then, all at once, seizing the reporter\u2019s arm,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is he! It can only be he!\u201D he cried, \u201Che!?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Then, falling back on the seat, he murmured a name which Gideon Spilett alone
  could hear.</p>
- <p>The reporter evidently knew this name, for it had a wonderful effect upon him,
  and he answered in a hoarse voice,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CHe! an outlawed man!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe!\u201D said Harding.</p>"
- "<p>At the engineer\u2019s command the boat approached this singular floating apparatus.\
  \ The boat touched the left side, from which escaped a ray of light through a thick\
  \ glass.</p>"
- <p>Harding and his companions mounted on the platform. An open hatchway was there.
  All darted down the opening.</p>
- <p>At the bottom of the ladder was a deck, lighted by electricity. At the end of
  this deck was a door, which Harding opened.</p>
- "<p>A richly\u2011ornamented room, quickly traversed by the colonists, was joined\
  \ to a library, over which a luminous ceiling shed a flood of light.</p>"
- <p>At the end of the library a large door, also shut, was opened by the engineer.</p>
- <p>An immense saloon?a sort of museum, in which were heaped up, with all the treasures
  of the mineral world, works of art, marvels of industry?appeared before the eyes
  of the colonists, who almost thought themselves suddenly transported into a land
  of enchantment.</p>
- <p>Stretched on a rich sofa they saw a man, who did not appear to notice their presence.</p>
- <p>Then Harding raised his voice, and to the extreme surprise of his companions,
  he uttered these words,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Nemo, you asked for us! We are here.?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 16</p>
- <p>At these words the reclining figure rose, and the electric light fell upon his
  countenance; a magnificent head, the forehead high, the glance commanding, beard
  white, hair abundant and falling over the shoulders.</p>
- <p>His hand rested upon the cushion of the divan from which he had just risen. He
  appeared perfectly calm. It was evident that his strength had been gradually undermined
  by illness, but his voice seemed yet powerful, as he said in English, and in a tone
  which evinced extreme surprise,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CSir, I have no name.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNevertheless, I know you!\u201D replied Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- <p>Captain Nemo fixed his penetrating gaze upon the engineer, as though he were
  about to annihilate him.</p>
- <p>Then, falling back amid the pillows of the divan,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CAfter all, what matters now?\u201D he murmured; \u201CI am dying!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding drew near the captain, and Gideon Spilett took his hand?it was
  of a feverish heat. Ayrton, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb stood respectfully apart
  in an angle of the magnificent saloon, whose atmosphere was saturated with the electric
  fluid.</p>
- <p>Meanwhile Captain Nemo withdrew his hand, and motioned the engineer and the reporter
  to be seated.</p>
- "<p>All regarded him with profound emotion. Before them they beheld that being whom\
  \ they had styled the \u201Cgenius of the island,\u201D the powerful protector whose\
  \ intervention, in so many circumstances, had been so efficacious, the benefactor\
  \ to whom they owed such a debt of gratitude! Their eyes beheld a man only, and\
  \ a man at the point of death, where Pencroft and Neb had expected to find an almost\
  \ supernatural being!</p>"
- <p>But how happened it that Cyrus Harding had recognized Captain Nemo? why had the
  latter so suddenly risen on hearing this name uttered, a name which he had believed
  known to none??</p>
- <p>The captain had resumed his position on the divan, and leaning on his arm, he
  regarded the engineer, seated near him.</p>
- "<p>\u201CYou know the name I formerly bore, sir?\u201D he asked.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI do,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding, \u201Cand also that of this wonderful\
  \ submarine vessel?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe ?Nautilus\u2019?\u201D said the captain, with a faint smile.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe ?Nautilus.\u201C</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut do you?do you know who I am?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI do.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is nevertheless many years since I have held any communication with\
  \ the inhabited world; three long years have I passed in the depth of the sea, the\
  \ only place where I have found liberty! Who then can have betrayed my secret?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CA man who was bound to you by no tie, Captain Nemo, and who, consequently,\
  \ cannot be accused of treachery.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe Frenchman who was cast on board my vessel by chance sixteen years\
  \ since?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe same.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHe and his two companions did not then perish in the maelstrom, in the\
  \ midst of which the ?Nautilus\u2019 was struggling?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey escaped, and a book has appeared under the title of ?Twenty Thousand\
  \ Leagues Under the Sea,\u2019 which contains your history.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe history of a few months only of my life!\u201D interrupted the captain\
  \ impetuously.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is true,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding, \u201Cbut a few months of that\
  \ strange life have sufficed to make you known.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAs a great criminal, doubtless!\u201D said Captain Nemo, a haughty smile\
  \ curling his lips. \u201CYes, a rebel, perhaps an outlaw against humanity!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The engineer was silent.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWell, sir?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is not for me to judge you, Captain Nemo,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding,\
  \ \u201Cat any rate as regards your past life. I am, with the rest of the world,\
  \ ignorant of the motives which induced you to adopt this strange mode of existence,\
  \ and I cannot judge of effects without knowing their causes; but what I do know\
  \ is, that a beneficent hand has constantly protected us since our arrival on Lincoln\
  \ Island, that we all owe our lives to a good, generous, and powerful being, and\
  \ that this being so powerful, good and generous, Captain Nemo, is yourself!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is I,\u201D answered the captain simply.</p>"
- <p>The engineer and the reporter rose. Their companions had drawn near, and the
  gratitude with which their hearts were charged was about to express itself in their
  gestures and words.</p>
- <p>Captain Nemo stopped them by a sign, and in a voice which betrayed more emotion
  than he doubtless intended to show.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWait till you have heard all,\u201D he said.</p>"
- <p>And the captain, in a few concise sentences, ran over the events of his life.</p>
- <p>His narrative was short, yet he was obliged to summon up his whole remaining
  energy to arrive at the end. He was evidently contending against extreme weakness.
  Several times Cyrus Harding entreated him to repose for a while, but he shook his
  head as a man to whom the morrow may never come, and when the reporter offered his
  assistance,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is useless,\u201D he said; \u201Cmy hours are numbered.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Captain Nemo was an Indian, the Prince Dakkar, son of a rajah of the then independent
  territory of Bundelkund. His father sent him, when ten years of age, to Europe,
  in order that he might receive an education in all respects complete, and in the
  hopes that by his talents and knowledge he might one day take a leading part in
  raising his long degraded and heathen country to a level with the nations of Europe.</p>
- <p>From the age of ten years to that of thirty Prince Dakkar, endowed by Nature
  with her richest gifts of intellect, accumulated knowledge of every kind, and in
  science, literature, and art his researches were extensive and profound.</p>
- <p>He traveled over the whole of Europe. His rank and fortune caused him to be everywhere
  sought after; but the pleasures of the world had for him no attractions. Though
  young and possessed of every personal advantage, he was ever grave?somber even?devoured
  by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, and cherishing in the recesses of his heart
  the hope that he might become a great and powerful ruler of a free and enlightened
  people.</p>
- <p>Still, for long the love of science triumphed over all other feelings. He became
  an artist deeply impressed by the marvels of art, a philosopher to whom no one of
  the higher sciences was unknown, a statesman versed in the policy of European courts.
  To the eyes of those who observed him superficially he might have passed for one
  of those cosmopolitans, curious of knowledge, but disdaining action; one of those
  opulent travelers, haughty and cynical, who move incessantly from place to place,
  and are of no country.</p>
- "<p>The history of Captain Nemo has, in fact, been published under the title of\
  \ \u201CTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.\u201D Here, therefore, will apply\
  \ the observation already made as to the adventures of Ayrton with regard to the\
  \ discrepancy of dates. Readers should therefore refer to the note already published\
  \ on this point.</p>"
- <p>This artist, this philosopher, this man was, however, still cherishing the hope
  instilled into him from his earliest days.</p>
- <p>Prince Dakkar returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849. He married a noble Indian
  lady, who was imbued with an ambition not less ardent than that by which he was
  inspired. Two children were born to them, whom they tenderly loved. But domestic
  happiness did not prevent him from seeking to carry out the object at which he aimed.
  He waited an opportunity. At length, as he vainly fancied, it presented itself.</p>
- <p>Instigated by princes equally ambitious and less sagacious and more unscrupulous
  than he was, the people of India were persuaded that they might successfully rise
  against their English rulers, who had brought them out of a state of anarchy and
  constant warfare and misery, and had established peace and prosperity in their country.
  Their ignorance and gross superstition made them the facile tools of their designing
  chiefs.</p>
- "<p>In 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out. Prince Dakkar, under the belief that\
  \ he should thereby have the opportunity of attaining the object of his long\u2011\
  cherished ambition, was easily drawn into it. He forthwith devoted his talents and\
  \ wealth to the service of this cause. He aided it in person; he fought in the front\
  \ ranks; he risked his life equally with the humblest of the wretched and misguided\
  \ fanatics; he was ten times wounded in twenty engagements, seeking death but finding\
  \ it not, but at length the sanguinary rebels were utterly defeated, and the atrocious\
  \ mutiny was brought to an end.</p>"
- <p>Never before had the British power in India been exposed to such danger, and
  if, as they had hoped, the sepoys had received assistance from without, the influence
  and supremacy in Asia of the United Kingdom would have been a thing of the past.</p>
- <p>The name of Prince Dakkar was at that time well known. He had fought openly and
  without concealment. A price was set upon his head, but he managed to escape from
  his pursuers.</p>
- <p>Civilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it onwards. The
  sepoys were vanquished, and the land of the rajahs of old fell again under the rule
  of England.</p>
- <p>Prince Dakkar, unable to find that death he courted, returned to the mountain
  fastnesses of Bundelkund. There, alone in the world, overcome by disappointment
  at the destruction of all his vain hopes, a prey to profound disgust for all human
  beings, filled with hatred of the civilized world, he realized the wreck of his
  fortune, assembled some score of his most faithful companions, and one day disappeared,
  leaving no trace behind.</p>
- <p>Where, then, did he seek that liberty denied him upon the inhabited earth? Under
  the waves, in the depths of the ocean, where none could follow.</p>
- "<p>The warrior became the man of science. Upon a deserted island of the Pacific\
  \ he established his dockyard, and there a submarine vessel was constructed from\
  \ his designs. By methods which will at some future day be revealed he had rendered\
  \ subservient the illimitable forces of electricity, which, extracted from inexhaustible\
  \ sources, was employed for all the requirements of his floating equipage, as a\
  \ moving, lighting, and heating agent. The sea, with its countless treasures, its\
  \ myriads of fish, its numberless wrecks, its enormous mammalia, and not only all\
  \ that nature supplied, but also all that man had lost in its depths, sufficed for\
  \ every want of the prince and his crew?and thus was his most ardent desire accomplished,\
  \ never again to hold communication with the earth. He named his submarine vessel\
  \ the \u201CNautilus,\u201D called himself simply Captain Nemo, and disappeared\
  \ beneath the seas.</p>"
- <p>During many years this strange being visited every ocean, from pole to pole.
  Outcast of the inhabited earth in these unknown worlds he gathered incalculable
  treasures. The millions lost in the Bay of Vigo, in 1702, by the galleons of Spain,
  furnished him with a mine of inexhaustible riches which he devoted always, anonymously,
  in favor of those nations who fought for the independence of their country.</p>
- <p>  (This refers to the resurrection of the Candiotes, who were, in</p>
- <p>   fact, largely assisted by Captain Nemo.)</p>
- "<p>For long, however, he had held no communication with his fellow\u2011creatures,\
  \ when, during the night of the 6th of November, 1866, three men were cast on board\
  \ his vessel. They were a French professor, his servant, and a Canadian fisherman.\
  \ These three men had been hurled overboard by a collision which had taken place\
  \ between the \u201CNautilus\u201D and the United States frigate \u201CAbraham Lincoln,\u201D\
  \ which had chased her.</p>"
- "<p>Captain Nemo learned from this professor that the \u201CNautilus,\u201D taken\
  \ now for a gigantic mammal of the whale species, now for a submarine vessel carrying\
  \ a crew of pirates, was sought for in every sea.</p>"
- <p>He might have returned these three men to the ocean, from whence chance had brought
  them in contact with his mysterious existence. Instead of doing this he kept them
  prisoners, and during seven months they were enabled to behold all the wonders of
  a voyage of twenty thousand leagues under the sea.</p>
- "<p>One day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew nothing of the past\
  \ history of Captain Nemo, succeeded in escaping in one of the \u201CNautilus\u2019\
  s\u201D boats. But as at this time the \u201CNautilus\u201D was drawn into the vortex\
  \ of the maelstrom, off the coast of Norway, the captain naturally believed that\
  \ the fugitives, engulfed in that frightful whirlpool, found their death at the\
  \ bottom of the abyss. He was unaware that the Frenchman and his two companions\
  \ had been miraculously cast on shore, that the fishermen of the Lofoten Islands\
  \ had rendered them assistance, and that the professor, on his return to France,\
  \ had published that work in which seven months of the strange and eventful navigation\
  \ of the \u201CNautilus\u201D were narrated and exposed to the curiosity of the\
  \ public.</p>"
- "<p>For a long time after this, Captain Nemo continued to live thus, traversing\
  \ every sea. But one by one his companions died, and found their last resting\u2011\
  place in their cemetery of coral, in the bed of the Pacific. At last Captain Nemo\
  \ remained the solitary survivor of all those who had taken refuge with him in the\
  \ depths of the ocean.</p>"
- "<p>He was now sixty years of age. Although alone, he succeeded in navigating the\
  \ \u201CNautilus\u201D towards one of those submarine caverns which had sometimes\
  \ served him as a harbor.</p>"
- "<p>One of these ports was hollowed beneath Lincoln Island, and at this moment furnished\
  \ an asylum to the \u201CNautilus.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The captain had now remained there six years, navigating the ocean no longer,\
  \ but awaiting death, and that moment when he should rejoin his former companions,\
  \ when by chance he observed the descent of the balloon which carried the prisoners\
  \ of the Confederates. Clad in his diving dress he was walking beneath the water\
  \ at a few cables\u2019 length from the shore of the island, when the engineer had\
  \ been thrown into the sea. Moved by a feeling of compassion the captain saved Cyrus\
  \ Harding.</p>"
- "<p>His first impulse was to fly from the vicinity of the five castaways; but his\
  \ harbor refuge was closed, for in consequence of an elevation of the basalt, produced\
  \ by the influence of volcanic action, he could no longer pass through the entrance\
  \ of the vault. Though there was sufficient depth of water to allow a light craft\
  \ to pass the bar, there was not enough for the \u201CNautilus,\u201D whose draught\
  \ of water was considerable.</p>"
- <p>Captain Nemo was compelled, therefore, to remain. He observed these men thrown
  without resources upon a desert island, but had no wish to be himself discovered
  by them. By degrees he became interested in their efforts when he saw them honest,
  energetic, and bound to each other by the ties of friendship. As if despite his
  wishes, he penetrated all the secrets of their existence. By means of the diving
  dress he could easily reach the well in the interior of Granite House, and climbing
  by the projections of rock to its upper orifice he heard the colonists as they recounted
  the past, and studied the present and future. He learned from them the tremendous
  conflict of America with America itself, for the abolition of slavery. Yes, these
  men were worthy to reconcile Captain Nemo with that humanity which they represented
  so nobly in the island.</p>
- <p>Captain Nemo had saved Cyrus Harding. It was he also who had brought back the
  dog to the Chimneys, who rescued Top from the waters of the lake, who caused to
  fall at Flotsam Point the case containing so many things useful to the colonists,
  who conveyed the canoe back into the stream of the Mercy, who cast the cord from
  the top of Granite House at the time of the attack by the baboons, who made known
  the presence of Ayrton upon Tabor Island, by means of the document enclosed in the
  bottle, who caused the explosion of the brig by the shock of a torpedo placed at
  the bottom of the canal, who saved Herbert from certain death by bringing the sulphate
  of quinine; and finally, it was he who had killed the convicts with the electric
  balls, of which he possessed the secret, and which he employed in the chase of submarine
  creatures. Thus were explained so many apparently supernatural occurrences, and
  which all proved the generosity and power of the captain.</p>
- "<p>Nevertheless, this noble misanthrope longed to benefit his proteges still further.\
  \ There yet remained much useful advice to give them, and, his heart being softened\
  \ by the approach of death, he invited, as we are aware, the colonists of Granite\
  \ House to visit the \u201CNautilus,\u201D by means of a wire which connected it\
  \ with the corral. Possibly he would not have done this had he been aware that Cyrus\
  \ Harding was sufficiently acquainted with his history to address him by the name\
  \ of Nemo.</p>"
- <p>The captain concluded the narrative of his life. Cyrus Harding then spoke; he
  recalled all the incidents which had exercised so beneficent an influence upon the
  colony, and in the names of his companions and himself thanked the generous being
  to whom they owed so much.</p>
- <p>But Captain Nemo paid little attention; his mind appeared to be absorbed by one
  idea, and without taking the proffered hand of the engineer,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CNow, sir,\u201D said he, \u201Cnow that you know my history, your judgment!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>In saying this, the captain evidently alluded to an important incident witnessed\
  \ by the three strangers thrown on board his vessel, and which the French professor\
  \ had related in his work, causing a profound and terrible sensation. Some days\
  \ previous to the flight of the professor and his two companions, the \u201CNautilus,\u201D\
  \ being chased by a frigate in the north of the Atlantic had hurled herself as a\
  \ ram upon this frigate, and sunk her without mercy.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding understood the captain\u2019s allusion, and was silent.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt was an enemy\u2019s frigate,\u201D exclaimed Captain Nemo, transformed\
  \ for an instant into the Prince Dakkar, \u201Can enemy\u2019s frigate! It was she\
  \ who attacked me?I was in a narrow and shallow bay?the frigate barred my way?and\
  \ I sank her!\u201D</p>"
- <p>A few moments of silence ensued; then the captain demanded,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CWhat think you of my life, gentlemen?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding extended his hand to the ci\u2011devant prince and replied gravely,\
  \ \u201CSir, your error was in supposing that the past can be resuscitated, and\
  \ in contending against inevitable progress. It is one of those errors which some\
  \ admire, others blame; which God alone can judge. He who is mistaken in an action\
  \ which he sincerely believes to be right may be an enemy, but retains our esteem.\
  \ Your error is one that we may admire, and your name has nothing to fear from the\
  \ judgment of history, which does not condemn heroic folly, but its results.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>The old man\u2019s breast swelled with emotion, and raising his hand to heaven,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWas I wrong, or in the right?\u201D he murmured.</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding replied, \u201CAll great actions return to God, from whom they\
  \ are derived. Captain Nemo, we, whom you have succored, shall ever mourn your loss.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Herbert, who had drawn near the captain, fell on his knees and kissed his hand.</p>
- "<p>A tear glistened in the eyes of the dying man. \u201CMy child,\u201D he said,\
  \ \u201Cmay God bless you!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Chapter 17</p>
- "<p>Day had returned. No ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the cavern.\
  \ It being high\u2011water, the entrance was closed by the sea. But the artificial\
  \ light, which escaped in long streams from the skylights of the \u201CNautilus\u201D\
  \ was as vivid as before, and the sheet of water shone around the floating vessel.</p>"
- "<p>An extreme exhaustion now overcame Captain Nemo, who had fallen back upon the\
  \ divan. It was useless to contemplate removing him to Granite House, for he had\
  \ expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those marvels of the \u201CNautilus\u201D\
  \ which millions could not have purchased, and to wait there for that death which\
  \ was swiftly approaching.</p>"
- <p>During a long interval of prostration, which rendered him almost unconscious,
  Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett attentively observed the condition of the dying
  man. It was apparent that his strength was gradually diminishing. That frame, once
  so robust, was now but the fragile tenement of a departing soul. All of life was
  concentrated in the heart and head.</p>
- <p>The engineer and reporter consulted in whispers. Was it possible to render any
  aid to the dying man? Might his life, if not saved, be prolonged for some days?
  He himself had said that no remedy could avail, and he awaited with tranquillity
  that death which had for him no terrors.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe can do nothing,\u201D said Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut of what is he dying?\u201D asked Pencroft.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLife is simply fading out,\u201D replied the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNevertheless,\u201D said the sailor, \u201Cif we move him into the open\
  \ air, and the light of the sun, he might perhaps recover.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Pencroft,\u201D answered the engineer, \u201Cit is useless to attempt\
  \ it. Besides, Captain Nemo would never consent to leave his vessel. He has lived\
  \ for a dozen years on board the ?Nautilus,\u2019 and on board the ?Nautilus\u2019\
  \ he desires to die.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Without doubt Captain Nemo heard Cyrus Harding\u2019s reply, for he raised himself\
  \ slightly, and in a voice more feeble, but always intelligible,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou are right, sir,\u201D he said. \u201CI shall die here?it is my wish;\
  \ and therefore I have a request to make of you.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions had drawn near the divan, and now arranged the
  cushions in such a manner as to better support the dying man.</p>
- "<p>They saw his eyes wander over all the marvels of this saloon, lighted by the\
  \ electric rays which fell from the arabesques of the luminous ceiling. He surveyed,\
  \ one after the other, the pictures hanging from the splendid tapestries of the\
  \ partitions, the chef\u2011d\u2019oeuvres of the Italian, Flemish, French, and\
  \ Spanish masters; the statues of marble and bronze on their pedestals; the magnificent\
  \ organ, leaning against the after\u2011partition; the aquarium, in which bloomed\
  \ the most wonderful productions of the sea?marine plants, zoophytes, chaplets of\
  \ pearls of inestimable value; and, finally, his eyes rested on this device, inscribed\
  \ over the pediment of the museum?the motto of the \u201CNautilus\u201D?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMobilis in mobile.\u201D</p>"
- <p>His glance seemed to rest fondly for the last time on these masterpieces of art
  and of nature, to which he had limited his horizon during a sojourn of so many years
  in the abysses of the seas.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding respected the captain\u2019s silence, and waited till he should\
  \ speak.</p>"
- <p>After some minutes, during which, doubtless, he passed in review his whole life,
  Captain Nemo turned to the colonists and said,</p>
- "<p>\u201CYou consider yourselves, gentlemen, under some obligations to me?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain, believe us that we would give our lives to prolong yours.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CPromise, then,\u201D continued Captain Nemo, \u201Cto carry out my last\
  \ wishes, and I shall be repaid for all I have done for you.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe promise,\u201D said Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- <p>And by this promise he bound both himself and his companions.</p>
- "<p>\u201CGentlemen,\u201D resumed the captain, \u201Cto\u2011morrow I shall be\
  \ dead.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Herbert was about to utter an exclamation, but a sign from the captain arrested
  him.</p>
- "<p>\u201CTo\u2011morrow I shall die, and I desire no other tomb than the ?Nautilus.\u2019\
  \ It is my grave! All my friends repose in the depths of the ocean; their resting\u2011\
  place shall be mine.\u201D</p>"
- <p>These words were received with profound silence.</p>
- "<p>\u201CPay attention to my wishes,\u201D he continued. \u201CThe ?Nautilus\u2019\
  \ is imprisoned in this grotto, the entrance of which is blocked up; but, although\
  \ egress is impossible, the vessel may at least sink in the abyss, and there bury\
  \ my remains.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying man.</p>
- "<p>\u201CTo\u2011morrow, after my death, Mr. Harding,\u201D continued the captain,\
  \ \u201Cyourself and companions will leave the ?Nautilus,\u2019 for all the treasures\
  \ it contains must perish with me. One token alone will remain with you of Prince\
  \ Dakkar, with whose history you are now acquainted. That coffer yonder contains\
  \ diamonds of the value of many millions, most of them mementoes of the time when,\
  \ husband and father, I thought happiness possible for me, and a collection of pearls\
  \ gathered by my friends and myself in the depths of the ocean. Of this treasure\
  \ at a future day, you may make good use. In the hands of such men as yourself and\
  \ your comrades, Captain Harding, money will never be a source of danger. From on\
  \ high I shall still participate in your enterprises, and I fear not but that they\
  \ will prosper.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>After a few moments\u2019 repose, necessitated by his extreme weakness, Captain\
  \ Nemo continued,?</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo\u2011morrow you will take the coffer, you will leave the saloon, of\
  \ which you will close the door; then you will ascend on to the deck of the ?Nautilus,\u2019\
  \ and you will lower the mainhatch so as entirely to close the vessel.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt shall be done, captain,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGood. You will then embark in the canoe which brought you hither; but,\
  \ before leaving the ?Nautilus,\u2019 go to the stern and there open two large stop\u2011\
  cocks which you will find upon the water\u2011line. The water will penetrate into\
  \ the reservoirs, and the ?Nautilus\u2019 will gradually sink beneath the water\
  \ to repose at the bottom of the abyss.\u201D</p>"
- <p>And comprehending a gesture of Cyrus Harding, the captain added,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CFear nothing! You will but bury a corpse!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any observation to
  Captain Nemo. He had expressed his last wishes, and they had nothing to do but to
  conform to them.</p>
- "<p>\u201CI have your promise, gentlemen?\u201D added Captain Nemo.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou have, captain,\u201D replied the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>The captain thanked the colonists by a sign, and requested them to leave him\
  \ for some hours. Gideon Spilett wished to remain near him, in the event of a crisis\
  \ coming on, but the dying man refused, saying, \u201CI shall live until to\u2011\
  morrow, sir.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>All left the saloon, passed through the library and the dining\u2011room, and\
  \ arrived forward, in the machine\u2011room where the electrical apparatus was established,\
  \ which supplied not only heat and light, but the mechanical power of the \u201C\
  Nautilus.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The \u201CNautilus\u201D was a masterpiece containing masterpieces within itself,\
  \ and the engineer was struck with astonishment.</p>"
- "<p>The colonists mounted the platform, which rose seven or eight feet above the\
  \ water. There they beheld a thick glass lenticular covering, which protected a\
  \ kind of large eye, from which flashed forth light. Behind this eye was apparently\
  \ a cabin containing the wheels of the rudder, and in which was stationed the helmsman,\
  \ when he navigated the \u201CNautilus\u201D over the bed of the ocean, which the\
  \ electric rays would evidently light up to a considerable distance.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions remained for a time silent, for they were vividly
  impressed by what they had just seen and heard, and their hearts were deeply touched
  by the thought that he whose arm had so often aided them, the protector whom they
  had known but a few hours, was at the point of death.</p>
- "<p>Whatever might be the judgment pronounced by posterity upon the events of this,\
  \ so to speak, extra\u2011human existence, the character of Prince Dakkar would\
  \ ever remain as one of those whose memory time can never efface.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat a man!\u201D said Pencroft. \u201CIs it possible that he can have\
  \ lived at the bottom of the sea? And it seems to me that perhaps he has not found\
  \ peace there any more than elsewhere!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe ?Nautilus,\u201C observed Ayrton, \u201Cmight have enabled us to leave\
  \ Lincoln Island and reach some inhabited country.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGood Heavens!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201CI for one would never risk\
  \ myself in such a craft. To sail on the seas, good, but under the seas, never!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CI believe, Pencroft,\u201D answered the reporter, \u201Cthat the navigation\
  \ of a submarine vessel such as the ?Nautilus\u2019 ought to be very easy, and that\
  \ we should soon become accustomed to it. There would be no storms, no lee\u2011\
  shore to fear. At some feet beneath the surface the waters of the ocean are as calm\
  \ as those of a lake.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat may be,\u201D replied the sailor, \u201Cbut I prefer a gale of wind\
  \ on board a well\u2011found craft. A vessel is built to sail on the sea, and not\
  \ beneath it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy friends,\u201D said the engineer, \u201Cit is useless, at any rate\
  \ as regards the ?Nautilus,\u2019 to discuss the question of submarine vessels.\
  \ The ?Nautilus\u2019 is not ours, and we have not the right to dispose of it. Moreover,\
  \ we could in no case avail ourselves of it. Independently of the fact that it would\
  \ be impossible to get it out of this cavern, whose entrance is now closed by the\
  \ uprising of the basaltic rocks, Captain Nemo\u2019s wish is that it shall be buried\
  \ with him. His wish is our law, and we will fulfil it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>After a somewhat prolonged conversation, Cyrus Harding and his companions again\
  \ descended to the interior of the \u201CNautilus.\u201D There they took some refreshment\
  \ and returned to the saloon.</p>"
- <p>Captain Nemo had somewhat rallied from the prostration which had overcome him,
  and his eyes shone with their wonted fire. A faint smile even curled his lips.</p>
- <p>The colonists drew around him.</p>
- "<p>\u201CGentlemen,\u201D said the captain, \u201Cyou are brave and honest men.\
  \ You have devoted yourselves to the common weal. Often have I observed your conduct.\
  \ I have esteemed you?I esteem you still! Your hand, Mr. Harding.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding gave his hand to the captain, who clasped it affectionately.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt is well!\u201D he murmured.</p>"
- <p>He resumed,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut enough of myself. I have to speak concerning yourselves, and this\
  \ Lincoln Island, upon which you have taken refuge. You now desire to leave it?\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo return, captain!\u201D answered Pencroft quickly.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTo return, Pencroft?\u201D said the captain, with a smile. \u201CI know,\
  \ it is true, your love for this island. You have helped to make it what it now\
  \ is, and it seems to you a paradise!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201COur project, captain,\u201D interposed Cyrus Harding, \u201Cis to annex\
  \ it to the United States, and to establish for our shipping a port so fortunately\
  \ situated in this part of the Pacific.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYour thoughts are with your country, gentlemen,\u201D continued the captain;\
  \ \u201Cyour toils are for her prosperity and glory. You are right. One\u2019s native\
  \ land!?there should one live! there die! And I die far from all I loved!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CYou have some last wish to transmit,\u201D said the engineer with emotion,\
  \ \u201Csome souvenir to send to those friends you have left in the mountains of\
  \ India?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNo, Captain Harding; no friends remain to me! I am the last of my race,\
  \ and to all whom I have known I have long been as are the dead.?But to return to\
  \ yourselves. Solitude, isolation, are painful things, and beyond human endurance.\
  \ I die of having thought it possible to live alone! You should, therefore, dare\
  \ all in the attempt to leave Lincoln Island, and see once more the land of your\
  \ birth. I am aware that those wretches have destroyed the vessel you have built.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe propose to construct a vessel,\u201D said Gideon Spilett, \u201Csufficiently\
  \ large to convey us to the nearest land; but if we should succeed, sooner or later\
  \ we shall return to Lincoln Island. We are attached to it by too many recollections\
  \ ever to forget it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is here that we have known Captain Nemo,\u201D said Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is here only that we can make our home!\u201D added Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd here shall I sleep the sleep of eternity, if?\u201D replied the captain.</p>"
- <p>He paused for a moment, and, instead of completing the sentence, said simply,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CMr. Harding, I wish to speak with you?alone!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The engineer\u2019s companions, respecting the wish, retired.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding remained but a few minutes alone with Captain Nemo, and soon recalled
  his companions; but he said nothing to them of the private matters which the dying
  man had confided to him.</p>
- <p>Gideon Spilett now watched the captain with extreme care. It was evident that
  he was no longer sustained by his moral energy, which had lost the power of reaction
  against his physical weakness.</p>
- "<p>The day closed without change. The colonists did not quit the \u201CNautilus\u201D\
  \ for a moment. Night arrived, although it was impossible to distinguish it from\
  \ day in the cavern.</p>"
- <p>Captain Nemo suffered no pain, but he was visibly sinking. His noble features,
  paled by the approach of death, were perfectly calm. Inaudible words escaped at
  intervals from his lips, bearing upon various incidents of his checkered career.
  Life was evidently ebbing slowly and his extremities were already cold.</p>
- <p>Once or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around him, and smiled
  on them with that last smile which continues after death.</p>
- <p>At length, shortly after midnight, Captain Nemo by a supreme effort succeeded
  in folding his arms across his breast, as if wishing in that attitude to compose
  himself for death.</p>
- "<p>By one o\u2019clock his glance alone showed signs of life. A dying light gleamed\
  \ in those eyes once so brilliant. Then, murmuring the words, \u201CGod and my country!\u201D\
  \ he quietly expired.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding, bending low closed the eyes of him who had once been the Prince
  Dakkar, and was now not even Captain Nemo.</p>
- "<p>Herbert and Pencroft sobbed aloud. Tears fell from Ayrton\u2019s eyes. Neb was\
  \ on his knees by the reporter\u2019s side, motionless as a statue.</p>"
- "<p>Then Cyrus Harding, extending his hand over the forehead of the dead, said solemnly,\
  \ \u201CMay his soul be with God!\u201D Turning to his friends, he added, \u201C\
  Let us pray for him whom we have lost!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Some hours later the colonists fulfilled the promise made to the captain by carrying
  out his dying wishes.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding and his companions quitted the \u201CNautilus,\u201D taking with\
  \ them the only memento left them by their benefactor, the coffer which contained\
  \ wealth amounting to millions.</p>"
- "<p>The marvelous saloon, still flooded with light, had been carefully closed. The\
  \ iron door leading on deck was then securely fastened in such a manner as to prevent\
  \ even a drop of water from penetrating to the interior of the \u201CNautilus.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The colonists then descended into the canoe, which was moored to the side of
  the submarine vessel.</p>
- "<p>The canoe was now brought around to the stern. There, at the water\u2011line,\
  \ were two large stop\u2011cocks communicating with the reservoirs employed in the\
  \ submersion of the vessel.</p>"
- "<p>The stop\u2011cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the \u201CNautilus,\u201D\
  \ slowly sinking, disappeared beneath the surface of the lake.</p>"
- "<p>But the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through the waves. The\
  \ powerful light it gave forth lighted up the translucent water, while the cavern\
  \ became gradually obscure. At length this vast effusion of electric light faded\
  \ away, and soon after the \u201CNautilus,\u201D now the tomb of Captain Nemo, reposed\
  \ in its ocean bed.</p>"
- <p>Chapter 18</p>
- "<p>At break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance of the cavern,\
  \ to which they gave the name of \u201CDakkar Grotto,\u201D in memory of Captain\
  \ Nemo. It was now low\u2011water, and they passed without difficulty under the\
  \ arcade, washed on the right by the sea.</p>"
- <p>The canoe was left here, carefully protected from the waves. As additional precaution,
  Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton drew it up on a little beach which bordered one of the
  sides of the grotto, in a spot where it could run no risk of harm.</p>
- <p>The storm had ceased during the night. The last low mutterings of the thunder
  died away in the west. Rain fell no longer, but the sky was yet obscured by clouds.
  On the whole, this month of October, the first of the southern spring, was not ushered
  in by satisfactory tokens, and the wind had a tendency to shift from one point of
  the compass to another, which rendered it impossible to count upon settled weather.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and his companions, on leaving Dakkar Grotto, had taken the road
  to the corral. On their way Neb and Herbert were careful to preserve the wire which
  had been laid down by the captain between the corral and the grotto, and which might
  at a future time be of service.</p>
- "<p>The colonists spoke but little on the road. The various incidents of the night\
  \ of October 15th had left a profound impression on their minds. The unknown being\
  \ whose influence had so effectually protected them, the man whom their imagination\
  \ had endowed with supernatural powers, Captain Nemo, was no more. His \u201CNautilus\u201D\
  \ and he were buried in the depths of the abyss. To each one of them their existence\
  \ seemed even more isolated than before. They had been accustomed to count upon\
  \ the intervention of that power which existed no longer, and Gideon Spilett, and\
  \ even Cyrus Harding, could not escape this impression. Thus they maintained a profound\
  \ silence during their journey to the corral.</p>"
- <p>Towards nine in the morning the colonists arrived at Granite House.</p>
- <p>It had been agreed that the construction of the vessel should be actively pushed
  forward, and Cyrus Harding more than ever devoted his time and labor to this object.
  It was impossible to divine what future lay before them. Evidently the advantage
  to the colonists would be great of having at their disposal a substantial vessel,
  capable of keeping the sea even in heavy weather, and large enough to attempt, in
  case of need, a voyage of some duration. Even if, when their vessel should be completed,
  the colonists should not resolve to leave Lincoln Island as yet, in order to gain
  either one of the Polynesian Archipelagoes of the Pacific or the shores of New Zealand,
  they might at least, sooner or later, proceed to Tabor Island, to leave there the
  notice relating to Ayrton. This was a precaution rendered indispensable by the possibility
  of the Scotch yacht reappearing in those seas, and it was of the highest importance
  that nothing should be neglected on this point.</p>
- "<p>The works were then resumed. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Ayrton, assisted by\
  \ Neb, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, except when unavoidably called off by other\
  \ necessary occupations, worked without cessation. It was important that the new\
  \ vessel should be ready in five months?that is to say, by the beginning of March?if\
  \ they wished to visit Tabor Island before the equinoctial gales rendered the voyage\
  \ impracticable. Therefore the carpenters lost not a moment. Moreover, it was unnecessary\
  \ to manufacture rigging, that of the \u201CSpeedy\u201D having been saved entire,\
  \ so that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed.</p>"
- <p>The end of the year 1868 found them occupied by these important labors, to the
  exclusion of almost all others. At the expiration of two months and a half the ribs
  had been set up and the first planks adjusted. It was already evident that the plans
  made by Cyrus Harding were admirable, and that the vessel would behave well at sea.</p>
- "<p>Pencroft brought to the task a devouring energy, and would even grumble when\
  \ one or the other abandoned the carpenter\u2019s axe for the gun of the hunter.\
  \ It was nevertheless necessary to keep up the stores of Granite House, in view\
  \ of the approaching winter. But this did not satisfy Pencroft. The brave, honest\
  \ sailor was not content when the workmen were not at the dockyard. When this happened\
  \ he grumbled vigorously, and, by way of venting his feelings, did the work of six\
  \ men.</p>"
- <p>The weather was very unfavorable during the whole of the summer season. For some
  days the heat was overpowering, and the atmosphere, saturated with electricity,
  was only cleared by violent storms. It was rarely that the distant growling of the
  thunder could not be heard, like a low but incessant murmur, such as is produced
  in the equatorial regions of the globe.</p>
- "<p>The 1st of January, 1869, was signalized by a storm of extreme violence, and\
  \ the thunder burst several times over the island. Large trees were struck by the\
  \ electric fluid and shattered, and among others one of those gigantic nettle\u2011\
  trees which had shaded the poultry\u2011yard at the southern extremity of the lake.\
  \ Had this meteor any relation to the phenomena going on in the bowels of the earth?\
  \ Was there any connection between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the\
  \ interior of the earth? Cyrus Harding was inclined to think that such was the case,\
  \ for the development of these storms was attended by the renewal of volcanic symptoms.</p>"
- "<p>It was on the 3rd of January that Herbert, having ascended at daybreak to the\
  \ plateau of Prospect Heights to harness one of the onagers, perceived an enormous\
  \ hat\u2011shaped cloud rolling from the summit of the volcano.</p>"
- <p>Herbert immediately apprised the colonists, who at once joined him in watching
  the summit of Mount Franklin.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAh!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201Cthose are not vapors this time! It\
  \ seems to me that the giant is not content with breathing; he must smoke!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>This figure of speech employed by the sailor exactly expressed the changes going
  on at the mouth of the volcano. Already for three months had the crater emitted
  vapors more or less dense, but which were as yet produced only by an internal ebullition
  of mineral substances. But now the vapors were replaced by a thick smoke, rising
  in the form of a grayish column, more than three hundred feet in width at its base,
  and which spread like an immense mushroom to a height of from seven to eight hundred
  feet above the summit of the mountain.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe fire is in the chimney,\u201D observed Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd we can\u2019t put it out!\u201D replied Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe volcano ought to be swept,\u201D observed Neb, who spoke as if perfectly\
  \ serious.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell said, Neb!\u201D cried Pencroft, with a shout of laughter; \u201C\
  and you\u2019ll undertake the job, no doubt?\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding attentively observed the dense smoke emitted by Mount Franklin,
  and even listened, as if expecting to hear some distant muttering. Then, turning
  towards his companions, from whom he had gone somewhat apart, he said,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe truth is, my friends, we must not conceal from ourselves that an important\
  \ change is going forward. The volcanic substances are no longer in a state of ebullition,\
  \ they have caught fire, and we are undoubtedly menaced by an approaching eruption.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, captain,\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cwe shall witness the eruption;\
  \ and if it is a good one, we\u2019ll applaud it. I don\u2019t see that we need\
  \ concern ourselves further about the matter.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt may be so,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cfor the ancient track\
  \ of the lava is still open; and thanks to this, the crater has hitherto overflowed\
  \ towards the north. And yet?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAnd yet, as we can derive no advantage from an eruption, it might be better\
  \ it should not take place,\u201D said the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWho knows?\u201D answered the sailor. \u201CPerhaps there may be some\
  \ valuable substance in this volcano, which it will spout forth, and which we may\
  \ turn to good account!\u201D</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding shook his head with the air of a man who augured no good from the
  phenomenon whose development had been so sudden. He did not regard so lightly as
  Pencroft the results of an eruption. If the lava, in consequence of the position
  of the crater, did not directly menace the wooded and cultivated parts of the island,
  other complications might present themselves. In fact, eruptions are not unfrequently
  accompanied by earthquakes; and an island of the nature of Lincoln Island, formed
  of substances so varied, basalt on one side, granite on the other, lava on the north,
  rich soil on the south, substances which consequently could not be firmly attached
  to each other, would be exposed to the risk of disintegration. Although, therefore,
  the spreading of the volcanic matter might not constitute a serious danger, any
  movement of the terrestrial structure which should shake the island might entail
  the gravest consequences.</p>
- "<p>\u201CIt seems to me,\u201D said Ayrton, who had reclined so as to place his\
  \ ear to the ground, \u201Cit seems to me that I can hear a dull, rumbling sound,\
  \ like that of a wagon loaded with bars of iron.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>The colonists listened with the greatest attention, and were convinced that\
  \ Ayrton was not mistaken. The rumbling was mingled with a subterranean roar, which\
  \ formed a sort of rinforzando, and died slowly away, as if some violent storm had\
  \ passed through the profundities of the globe. But no explosion properly so termed,\
  \ could be heard. It might therefore be concluded that the vapors and smoke found\
  \ a free passage through the central shaft; and that the safety\u2011valve being\
  \ sufficiently large, no convulsion would be produced, no explosion was to be apprehended.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, then!\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Care we not going back to work?\
  \ Let Mount Franklin smoke, groan, bellow, or spout forth fire and flame as much\
  \ as it pleases, that is no reason why we should be idle! Come, Ayrton, Neb, Herbert,\
  \ Captain Harding, Mr. Spilett, every one of us must turn to at our work to\u2011\
  day! We are going to place the keelson, and a dozen pair of hands would not be too\
  \ many. Before two months I want our new ?Bonadventure\u2019?for we shall keep the\
  \ old name, shall we not??to float on the waters of Port Balloon! Therefore there\
  \ is not an hour to lose!\u201D</p>"
- <p>All the colonists, their services thus requisitioned by Pencroft, descended to
  the dockyard, and proceeded to place the keelson, a thick mass of wood which forms
  the lower portion of a ship and unites firmly the timbers of the hull. It was an
  arduous undertaking, in which all took part.</p>
- <p>They continued their labors during the whole of this day, the 3rd of January,
  without thinking further of the volcano, which could not, besides, be seen from
  the shore of Granite House. But once or twice, large shadows, veiling the sun, which
  described its diurnal arc through an extremely clear sky, indicated that a thick
  cloud of smoke passed between its disc and the island. The wind, blowing on the
  shore, carried all these vapors to the westward. Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett
  remarked these somber appearances, and from time to time discussed the evident progress
  of the volcanic phenomena, but their work went on without interruption. It was,
  besides, of the first importance from every point of view, that the vessel should
  be finished with the least possible delay. In presence of the eventualities which
  might arise, the safety of the colonists would be to a great extent secured by their
  ship. Who could tell that it might not prove some day their only refuge?</p>
- <p>In the evening, after supper, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert again
  ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights. It was already dark, and the obscurity
  would permit them to ascertain if flames or incandescent matter thrown up by the
  volcano were mingled with the vapor and smoke accumulated at the mouth of the crater.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe crater is on fire!\u201D said Herbert, who, more active than his companion,\
  \ first reached the plateau.</p>"
- <p>Mount Franklin, distant about six miles, now appeared like a gigantic torch,
  around the summit of which turned fuliginous flames. So much smoke, and possibly
  scoriae and cinders were mingled with them, that their light gleamed but faintly
  amid the gloom of the night. But a kind of lurid brilliancy spread over the island,
  against which stood out confusedly the wooded masses of the heights. Immense whirlwinds
  of vapor obscured the sky, through which glimmered a few stars.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe change is rapid!\u201D said the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThat is not surprising,\u201D answered the reporter. \u201CThe reawakening\
  \ of the volcano already dates back some time. You may remember, Cyrus, that the\
  \ first vapors appeared about the time we searched the sides of the mountain to\
  \ discover Captain Nemo\u2019s retreat. It was, if I mistake not, about the 15th\
  \ of October.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Herbert, \u201Ctwo months and a half ago!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe subterranean fires have therefore been smoldering for ten weeks,\u201D\
  \ resumed Gideon Spilett, \u201Cand it is not to be wondered at that they now break\
  \ out with such violence!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDo not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?\u201D asked Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes,\u201D replied Gideon Spilett, \u201Cbut there is a great difference\
  \ between that and an earthquake.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI do not affirm that we are menaced with an earthquake,\u201D answered\
  \ Cyrus Harding, \u201Cmay God preserve us from that! No; these vibrations are due\
  \ to the effervescence of the central fire. The crust of the earth is simply the\
  \ shell of a boiler, and you know that such a shell, under the pressure of steam,\
  \ vibrates like a sonorous plate. It is this effect which is being produced at this\
  \ moment.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWhat magnificent flames!\u201D exclaimed Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>At this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the crater, the\
  \ brilliancy of which was visible even through the vapors. Thousands of luminous\
  \ sheets and barbed tongues of fire were cast in various directions. Some, extending\
  \ beyond the dome of smoke, dissipated it, leaving behind an incandescent powder.\
  \ This was accompanied by successive explosions, resembling the discharge of a battery\
  \ of machine\u2011guns.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Herbert, after spending an hour on the plateau
  of Prospect Heights, again descended to the beach, and returned to Granite House.
  The engineer was thoughtful and preoccupied, so much so, indeed, that Gideon Spilett
  inquired if he apprehended any immediate danger, of which the eruption might directly
  or indirectly be the cause.</p>
- "<p>\u201CYes, and no,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNevertheless,\u201D continued the reporter, \u201Cwould not the greatest\
  \ misfortune which could happen to us be an earthquake which would overturn the\
  \ island? Now, I do not suppose that this is to be feared, since the vapors and\
  \ lava have found a free outlet.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTrue,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cand I do not fear an earthquake\
  \ in the sense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions of the soil\
  \ provoked by the expansion of subterranean gases. But other causes may produce\
  \ great disasters.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHow so, my dear Cyrus?\u2019</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI am not certain. I must consider. I must visit the mountain. In a few\
  \ days I shall learn more on this point.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Gideon Spilett said no more, and soon, in spite of the explosions of the volcano,
  whose intensity increased, and which were repeated by the echoes of the island,
  the inhabitants of Granite House were sleeping soundly.</p>
- <p>Three days passed by?the 4th, 5th, and 6th of January. The construction of the
  vessel was diligently continued, and without offering further explanations the engineer
  pushed forward the work with all his energy. Mount Franklin was now hooded by a
  somber cloud of sinister aspect, and, amid the flames, vomiting forth incandescent
  rocks, some of which fell back into the crater itself. This caused Pencroft, who
  would only look at the matter in the light of a joke, to exclaim,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CAh! the giant is playing at cup and ball; he is a conjurer.\u201D</p>"
- <p>In fact, the substances thrown up fell back again in to the abyss, and it did
  not seem that the lava, though swollen by the internal pressure, had yet risen to
  the orifice of the crater. At any rate, the opening on the northeast, which was
  partly visible, poured out no torrent upon the northern slope of the mountain.</p>
- <p>Nevertheless, however pressing was the construction of the vessel, other duties
  demanded the presence of the colonists on various portions of the island. Before
  everything it was necessary to go to the corral, where the flocks of musmons and
  goats were enclosed, and replenish the provision of forage for those animals. It
  was accordingly arranged that Ayrton should proceed thither the next day, the 7th
  of January; and as he was sufficient for the task, to which he was accustomed, Pencroft
  and the rest were somewhat surprised on hearing the engineer say to Ayrton?</p>
- "<p>\u201CAs you are going to\u2011morrow to the corral I will accompany you.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut, Captain Harding,\u201D exclaimed the sailor, \u201Cour working days\
  \ will not be many, and if you go also we shall be two pair of hands short!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CWe shall return to\u2011morrow,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cbut\
  \ it is necessary that I should go to the corral. I must learn how the eruption\
  \ is progressing.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe eruption! always the eruption!\u201D answered Pencroft, with an air\
  \ of discontent. \u201CAn important thing, truly, this eruption! I trouble myself\
  \ very little about it.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Whatever might be the sailor\u2019s opinion, the expedition projected by the\
  \ engineer was settled for the next day. Herbert wished to accompany Cyrus Harding,\
  \ but he would not vex Pencroft by his absence.</p>"
- <p>The next day, at dawn, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, mounting the cart drawn by two
  onagers, took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot.</p>
- "<p>Above the forest were passing large clouds, to which the crater of Mount Franklin\
  \ incessantly added fuliginous matter. These clouds, which rolled heavily in the\
  \ air, were evidently composed of heterogeneous substances. It was not alone from\
  \ the volcano that they derived their strange opacity and weight. Scoriae, in a\
  \ state of dust, like powdered pumice\u2011stone, and grayish ashes as small as\
  \ the finest feculae, were held in suspension in the midst of their thick folds.\
  \ These ashes are so fine that they have been observed in the air for whole months.\
  \ After the eruption of 1783 in Iceland for upwards of a year the atmosphere was\
  \ thus charged with volcanic dust through which the rays of the sun were only with\
  \ difficulty discernible.</p>"
- <p>But more often this pulverized matter falls, and this happened on the present
  occasion. Cyrus Harding and Ayrton had scarcely reached the corral when a sort of
  black snow like fine gunpowder fell, and instantly changed the appearance of the
  soil. Trees, meadows, all disappeared beneath a covering several inches in depth.
  But, very fortunately, the wind blew from the northeast, and the greater part of
  the cloud dissolved itself over the sea.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThis is very singular, Captain Harding,\u201D said Ayrton.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is very serious,\u201D replied the engineer. \u201CThis powdered pumice\u2011\
  stone, all this mineral dust, proves how grave is the convulsion going forward in\
  \ the lower depths of the volcano.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut can nothing be done?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNothing, except to note the progress of the phenomenon. Do you, therefore,\
  \ Ayrton, occupy yourself with the necessary work at the corral. In the meantime\
  \ I will ascend just beyond the source of Red Creek and examine the condition of\
  \ the mountain upon its northern aspect. Then?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, Captain Harding?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThen we will pay a visit to Dakkar Grotto. I wish to inspect it. At any\
  \ rate I will come back for you in two hours.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Ayrton then proceeded to enter the corral, and, while awaiting the engineer\u2019\
  s return, busied himself with the musmons and goats which seemed to feel a certain\
  \ uneasiness in presence of these first signs of an eruption.</p>"
- <p>Meanwhile Cyrus Harding ascended the crest of the eastern spur, passed Red Creek,
  and arrived at the spot where he and his companions had discovered a sulphurous
  spring at the time of their first exploration.</p>
- <p>How changed was everything! Instead of a single column of smoke he counted thirteen,
  forced through the soil as if violently propelled by some piston. It was evident
  that the crust of the earth was subjected in this part of the globe to a frightful
  pressure. The atmosphere was saturated with gases and carbonic acid, mingled with
  aqueous vapors. Cyrus Harding felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn,
  and which was but pulverized cinders hardened into solid blocks by time, tremble
  beneath him, but he could discover no traces of fresh lava.</p>
- <p>The engineer became more assured of this when he observed all the northern part
  of Mount Franklin. Pillars of smoke and flame escaped from the crater; a hail of
  scoriae fell on the ground; but no current of lava burst from the mouth of the volcano,
  which proved that the volcanic matter had not yet attained the level of the superior
  orifice of the central shaft.</p>
- "<p>\u201CBut I would prefer that it were so,\u201D said Cyrus Harding to himself.\
  \ \u201CAt any rate, I should then know that the lava had followed its accustomed\
  \ track. Who can say that it may not take a new course? But the danger does not\
  \ consist in that! Captain Nemo foresaw it clearly! No, the danger does not lie\
  \ there!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>Cyrus Harding advanced towards the enormous causeway whose prolongation enclosed\
  \ the narrow Shark Gulf. He could now sufficiently examine on this side the ancient\
  \ channels of the lava. There was no doubt in his mind that the most recent eruption\
  \ had occurred at a far\u2011distant epoch.</p>"
- "<p>He then returned by the same way, listening attentively to the subterranean\
  \ mutterings which rolled like long\u2011continued thunder, interrupted by deafening\
  \ explosions. At nine in the morning he reached the corral.</p>"
- <p>Ayrton awaited him.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe animals are cared for, Captain Harding,\u201D said Ayrton.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGood, Ayrton.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThey seem uneasy, Captain Harding.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, instinct speaks through them, and instinct is never deceived.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CAre you ready?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CTake a lamp, Ayrton,\u201D answered the engineer; \u201Cwe will start\
  \ at once.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Ayrton did as desired. The onagers, unharnessed, roamed in the corral. The gate
  was secured on the outside, and Cyrus Harding, preceding Ayrton, took the narrow
  path which led westward to the shore.</p>
- <p>The soil they walked upon was choked with the pulverized matter fallen from the
  cloud. No quadruped appeared in the woods. Even the birds had fled. Sometimes a
  passing breeze raised the covering of ashes, and the two colonists, enveloped in
  a whirlwind of dust, lost sight of each other. They were then careful to cover their
  eyes and mouths with handkerchiefs, for they ran the risk of being blinded and suffocated.</p>
- "<p>It was impossible for Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, with these impediments, to make\
  \ rapid progress. Moreover, the atmosphere was close, as if the oxygen had been\
  \ partly burned up, and had become unfit for respiration. At every hundred paces\
  \ they were obliged to stop to take breath. It was therefore past ten o\u2019clock\
  \ when the engineer and his companion reached the crest of the enormous mass of\
  \ rocks of basalt and porphyry which composed the northwest coast of the island.</p>"
- <p>Ayrton and Cyrus Harding commenced the descent of this abrupt declivity, following
  almost step for step the difficult path which, during that stormy night, had led
  them to Dakkar Grotto. In open day the descent was less perilous, and, besides,
  the bed of ashes which covered the polished surface of the rock enabled them to
  make their footing more secure.</p>
- <p>The ridge at the end of the shore, about forty feet in height, was soon reached.
  Cyrus Harding recollected that this elevation gradually sloped towards the level
  of the sea. Although the tide was at present low, no beach could be seen, and the
  waves, thickened by the volcanic dust, beat upon the basaltic rocks.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding and Ayrton found without difficulty the entrance to Dakkar Grotto,
  and paused for a moment at the last rock before it.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe iron boat should be there,\u201D said the engineer.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is here, Captain Harding,\u201D replied Ayrton, drawing towards him\
  \ the fragile craft, which was protected by the arch of the vault.</p>"
- "<p>\u201COn board, Ayrton!\u201D</p>"
- <p>The two colonists stepped into the boat. A slight undulation of the waves carried
  it farther under the low arch of the crypt, and there Ayrton, with the aid of flint
  and steel, lighted the lamp. He then took the oars, and the lamp having been placed
  in the bow of the boat, so that its rays fell before them, Cyrus Harding took the
  helm and steered through the shades of the grotto.</p>
- "<p>The \u201CNautilus\u201D was there no longer to illuminate the cavern with its\
  \ electric light. Possibly it might not yet be extinguished, but no ray escaped\
  \ from the depths of the abyss in which reposed all that was mortal of Captain Nemo.</p>"
- <p>The light afforded by the lamp, although feeble, nevertheless enabled the engineer
  to advance slowly, following the wall of the cavern. A deathlike silence reigned
  under the vaulted roof, or at least in the anterior portion, for soon Cyrus Harding
  distinctly heard the rumbling which proceeded from the bowels of the mountain.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThat comes from the volcano,\u201D he said.</p>"
- <p>Besides these sounds, the presence of chemical combinations was soon betrayed
  by their powerful odor, and the engineer and his companion were almost suffocated
  by sulphurous vapors.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThis is what Captain Nemo feared,\u201D murmured Cyrus Harding, changing\
  \ countenance. \u201CWe must go to the end, notwithstanding.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CForward!\u201D replied Ayrton, bending to his oars and directing the boat\
  \ towards the head of the cavern.</p>"
- "<p>Twenty\u2011five minutes after entering the mouth of the grotto the boat reached\
  \ the extreme end.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding then, standing up, cast the light of the lamp upon the walls of
  the cavern which separated it from the central shaft of the volcano. What was the
  thickness of this wall? It might be ten feet or a hundred feet?it was impossible
  to say. But the subterranean sounds were too perceptible to allow of the supposition
  that it was of any great thickness.</p>
- <p>The engineer, after having explored the wall at a certain height horizontally,
  fastened the lamp to the end of an oar, and again surveyed the basaltic wall at
  a greater elevation.</p>
- "<p>There, through scarcely visible clefts and joinings, escaped a pungent vapor,\
  \ which infected the atmosphere of the cavern. The wall was broken by large cracks,\
  \ some of which extended to within two or three feet of the water\u2019s edge.</p>"
- <p>Cyrus Harding thought for a brief space. Then he said in a low voice,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CYes! the captain was right! The danger lies there, and a terrible danger!\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>Ayrton said not a word, but, upon a sign from Cyrus Harding, resumed the oars,
  and half an hour later the engineer and he reached the entrance of Dakkar Grotto.</p>
- <p>Chapter 19</p>
- <p>The next day, the 8th day of January, after a day and night passed at the corral,
  where they left all in order, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton arrived at Granite House.</p>
- <p>The engineer immediately called his companions together, and informed them of
  the imminent danger which threatened Lincoln Island, and from which no human power
  could deliver them.</p>
- "<p>\u201CMy friends,\u201D he said, and his voice betrayed the depth of his emotion,\
  \ \u201Cour island is not among those which will endure while this earth endures.\
  \ It is doomed to more or less speedy destruction, the cause of which it bears within\
  \ itself, and from which nothing can save it.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The colonists looked at each other, then at the engineer. They did not clearly
  comprehend him.</p>
- "<p>\u201CExplain yourself, Cyrus!\u201D said Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI will do so,\u201D replied Cyrus Harding, \u201Cor rather I will simply\
  \ afford you the explanation which, during our few minutes of private conversation,\
  \ was given me by Captain Nemo.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Nemo!\u201D exclaimed the colonists.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, and it was the last service he desired to render us before his death!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe last service!\u201D exclaimed Pencroft, \u201Cthe last service! You\
  \ will see that though he is dead he will render us others yet!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CBut what did the captain say?\u201D inquired the reporter.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI will tell you, my friends,\u201D said the engineer. \u201CLincoln Island\
  \ does not resemble the other islands of the Pacific, and a fact of which Captain\
  \ Nemo has made me cognizant must sooner or later bring about the subversion of\
  \ its foundation.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNonsense! Lincoln Island, it can\u2019t be!\u201D cried Pencroft, who,\
  \ in spite of the respect he felt for Cyrus Harding, could not prevent a gesture\
  \ of incredulity.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CListen, Pencroft,\u201D resumed the engineer, \u201CI will tell you what\
  \ Captain Nemo communicated to me, and which I myself confirmed yesterday, during\
  \ the exploration of Dakkar Grotto.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThis cavern stretches under the island as far as the volcano, and is only\
  \ separated from its central shaft by the wall which terminates it. Now, this wall\
  \ is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow the sulphurous gases generated\
  \ in the interior of the volcano to escape.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell?\u201D said Pencroft, his brow suddenly contracting.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWell, then, I saw that these fissures widen under the internal pressure\
  \ from within, that the wall of basalt is gradually giving way and that after a\
  \ longer or shorter period it will afford a passage to the waters of the lake which\
  \ fill the cavern.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CGood!\u201D replied Pencroft, with an attempt at pleasantry. \u201CThe\
  \ sea will extinguish the volcano, and there will be an end of the matter!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CNot so!\u201D said Cyrus Harding, \u201Cshould a day arrive when the sea,\
  \ rushing through the wall of the cavern, penetrates by the central shaft into the\
  \ interior of the island to the boiling lava, Lincoln Island will that day be blown\
  \ into the air?just as would happen to the island of Sicily were the Mediterranean\
  \ to precipitate itself into Mount Etna.\u201D</p>"
- <p>The colonists made no answer to these significant words of the engineer. They
  now understood the danger by which they were menaced.</p>
- <p>It may be added that Cyrus Harding had in no way exaggerated the danger to be
  apprehended. Many persons have formed an idea that it would be possible to extinguish
  volcanoes, which are almost always situated on the shores of a sea or lake, by opening
  a passage for the admission of the water. But they are not aware that this would
  be to incur the risk of blowing up a portion of the globe, like a boiler whose steam
  is suddenly expanded by intense heat. The water, rushing into a cavity whose temperature
  might be estimated at thousands of degrees, would be converted into steam with a
  sudden energy which no enclosure could resist.</p>
- <p>It was not therefore doubtful that the island, menaced by a frightful and approaching
  convulsion, would endure only so long as the wall of Dakkar Grotto itself should
  endure. It was not even a question of months, nor of weeks, but of days; it might
  be of hours.</p>
- <p>The first sentiment which the colonists felt was that of profound sorrow. They
  thought not so much of the peril which menaced themselves personally, but of the
  destruction of the island which had sheltered them, which they had cultivated, which
  they loved so well, and had hoped to render so flourishing. So much effort ineffectually
  expended, so much labor lost.</p>
- <p>Pencroft could not prevent a large tear from rolling down his cheek, nor did
  he attempt to conceal it.</p>
- <p>Some further conversation now took place. The chances yet in favor of the colonists
  were discussed; but finally it was agreed that there was not an hour to be lost,
  that the building and fitting of the vessel should be pushed forward with their
  utmost energy, and that this was the sole chance of safety for the inhabitants of
  Lincoln Island.</p>
- <p>All hands, therefore, set to work on the vessel. What could it avail to sow,
  to reap, to hunt, to increase the stores of Granite House? The contents of the storehouse
  and outbuildings contained more than sufficient to provide the ship for a voyage,
  however long might be its duration. But it was imperative that the ship should be
  ready to receive them before the inevitable catastrophe should arrive.</p>
- "<p>Their labors were now carried on with feverish ardor. By the 23rd of January\
  \ the vessel was half\u2011decked over. Up to this time no change had taken place\
  \ on the summit of the volcano. Vapor and smoke mingled with flames and incandescent\
  \ stones were thrown up from the crater. But during the night of the 23rd, in consequence\
  \ of the lava attaining the level of the first stratum of the volcano, the hat\u2011\
  shaped cone which formed over the latter disappeared. A frightful sound was heard.\
  \ The colonists at first thought the island was rent asunder, and rushed out of\
  \ Granite House.</p>"
- "<p>This occurred about two o\u2019clock in the morning.</p>"
- "<p>The sky appeared on fire. The superior cone, a mass of rock a thousand feet\
  \ in height, and weighing thousands of millions of pounds, had been thrown down\
  \ upon the island, making it tremble to its foundation. Fortunately, this cone inclined\
  \ to the north, and had fallen upon the plain of sand and tufa stretching between\
  \ the volcano and the sea. The aperture of the crater being thus enlarged projected\
  \ towards the sky a glare so intense that by the simple effect of reflection the\
  \ atmosphere appeared red\u2011hot. At the same time a torrent of lava, bursting\
  \ from the new summit, poured out in long cascades, like water escaping from a vase\
  \ too full, and a thousand tongues of fire crept over the sides of the volcano.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe corral! the corral!\u201D exclaimed Ayrton.</p>"
- <p>It was, in fact, towards the corral that the lava was rushing as the new crater
  faced the east, and consequently the fertile portions of the island, the springs
  of Red Creek and Jacamar Wood, were menaced with instant destruction.</p>
- "<p>At Ayrton\u2019s cry the colonists rushed to the onagers\u2019 stables. The\
  \ cart was at once harnessed. All were possessed by the same thought?to hasten to\
  \ the corral and set at liberty the animals it enclosed.</p>"
- <p>Before three in the morning they arrived at the corral. The cries of the terrified
  musmons and goats indicated the alarm which possessed them. Already a torrent of
  burning matter and liquefied minerals fell from the side of the mountain upon the
  meadows as far as the side of the palisade. The gate was burst open by Ayrton, and
  the animals, bewildered with terror, fled in all directions.</p>
- <p>An hour afterwards the boiling lava filled the corral, converting into vapor
  the water of the little rivulet which ran through it, burning up the house like
  dry grass, and leaving not even a post of the palisade to mark the spot where the
  corral once stood.</p>
- "<p>To contend against this disaster would have been folly?nay, madness. In presence\
  \ of Nature\u2019s grand convulsions man is powerless.</p>"
- <p>It was now daylight?the 24th of January. Cyrus Harding and his companions, before
  returning to Granite House, desired to ascertain the probable direction this inundation
  of lava was about to take. The soil sloped gradually from Mount Franklin to the
  east coast, and it was to be feared that, in spite of the thick Jacamar Wood, the
  torrent would reach the plateau of Prospect Heights.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe lake will cover us,\u201D said Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI hope so!\u201D was Cyrus Harding\u2019s only reply.</p>"
- "<p>The colonists were desirous of reaching the plain upon which the superior cone\
  \ of Mount Franklin had fallen, but the lava arrested their progress. It had followed,\
  \ on one side, the valley of Red Creek, and on the other that of Falls River, evaporating\
  \ those watercourses in its passage. There was no possibility of crossing the torrent\
  \ of lava; on the contrary, the colonists were obliged to retreat before it. The\
  \ volcano, without its crown, was no longer recognizable, terminated as it was by\
  \ a sort of flat table which replaced the ancient crater. From two openings in its\
  \ southern and eastern sides an unceasing flow of lava poured forth, thus forming\
  \ two distinct streams. Above the new crater a cloud of smoke and ashes, mingled\
  \ with those of the atmosphere, massed over the island. Loud peals of thunder broke,\
  \ and could scarcely be distinguished from the rumblings of the mountain, whose\
  \ mouth vomited forth ignited rocks, which, hurled to more than a thousand feet,\
  \ burst in the air like shells. Flashes of lightning rivaled in intensity the volcano\u2019\
  s eruption.</p>"
- <p>Towards seven in the morning the position was no longer tenable by the colonists,
  who accordingly took shelter in the borders of Jacamar Wood. Not only did the projectiles
  begin to rain around them, but the lava, overflowing the bed of Red Creek, threatened
  to cut off the road to the corral. The nearest rows of trees caught fire, and their
  sap, suddenly transformed into vapor, caused them to explode with loud reports,
  while others, less moist, remained unhurt in the midst of the inundation.</p>
- <p>The colonists had again taken the road to the corral. They proceeded but slowly,
  frequently looking back; but, in consequence of the inclination of the soil, the
  lava gained rapidly in the east, and as its lower waves became solidified others,
  at boiling heat, covered them immediately.</p>
- <p>Meanwhile, the principal stream of Red Creek Valley became more and more menacing.
  All this portion of the forest was on fire, and enormous wreaths of smoke rolled
  over the trees, whose trunks were already consumed by the lava.</p>
- <p>The colonists halted near the lake, about half a mile from the mouth of Red Creek.
  A question of life or death was now to be decided.</p>
- <p>Cyrus Harding, accustomed to the consideration of important crises, and aware
  that he was addressing men capable of hearing the truth, whatever it might be, then
  said,?</p>
- "<p>\u201CEither the lake will arrest the progress of the lava, and a part of the\
  \ island will be preserved from utter destruction, or the stream will overrun the\
  \ forests of the Far West, and not a tree or plant will remain on the surface of\
  \ the soil. We shall have no prospect but that of starvation upon these barren rocks?a\
  \ death which will probably be anticipated by the explosion of the island.\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn that case,\u201D replied Pencroft, folding his arms and stamping his\
  \ foot, \u201Cwhat\u2019s the use of working any longer on the vessel?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CPencroft,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding, \u201Cwe must do our duty to the\
  \ last!\u201D</p>"
- <p>At this instant the river of lava, after having broken a passage through the
  noble trees it devoured in its course, reached the borders of the lake. At this
  point there was an elevation of the soil which, had it been greater, might have
  sufficed to arrest the torrent.</p>
- "<p>\u201CTo work!\u201D cried Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>The engineer\u2019s thought was at once understood. It might be possible to\
  \ dam, as it were, the torrent, and thus compel it to pour itself into the lake.</p>"
- <p>The colonists hastened to the dockyard. They returned with shovels, picks, axes,
  and by means of banking the earth with the aid of fallen trees they succeeded in
  a few hours in raising an embankment three feet high and some hundreds of paces
  in length. It seemed to them, when they had finished, as if they had scarcely been
  working more than a few minutes.</p>
- <p>It was not a moment too soon. The liquefied substances soon after reached the
  bottom of the barrier. The stream of lava swelled like a river about to overflow
  its banks, and threatened to demolish the sole obstacle which could prevent it from
  overrunning the whole Far West. But the dam held firm, and after a moment of terrible
  suspense the torrent precipitated itself into Grant Lake from a height of twenty
  feet.</p>
- <p>The colonists, without moving or uttering a word, breathlessly regarded this
  strife of the two elements.</p>
- <p>What a spectacle was this conflict between water and fire! What pen could describe
  the marvelous horror of this scene?what pencil could depict it? The water hissed
  as it evaporated by contact with the boiling lava. The vapor whirled in the air
  to an immeasurable height, as if the valves of an immense boiler had been suddenly
  opened. But, however considerable might be the volume of water contained in the
  lake, it must eventually be absorbed, because it was not replenished, while the
  stream of lava, fed from an inexhaustible source, rolled on without ceasing new
  waves of incandescent matter.</p>
- <p>The first waves of lava which fell in the lake immediately solidified and accumulated
  so as speedily to emerge from it. Upon their surface fell other waves, which in
  their turn became stone, but a step nearer the center of the lake. In this manner
  was formed a pier which threatened to gradually fill up the lake, which could not
  overflow, the water displaced by the lava being evaporated. The hissing of the water
  rent the air with a deafening sound, and the vapor, blown by the wind, fell in rain
  upon the sea. The pier became longer and longer, and the blocks of lava piled themselves
  one on another. Where formerly stretched the calm waters of the lake now appeared
  an enormous mass of smoking rocks, as if an upheaving of the soil had formed immense
  shoals. Imagine the waters of the lake aroused by a hurricane, then suddenly solidified
  by an intense frost, and some conception may be formed of the aspect of the lake
  three hours after the eruption of this irresistible torrent of lava.</p>
- <p>This time water would be vanquished by fire.</p>
- "<p>Nevertheless it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonists that the effusion\
  \ of lava should have been in the direction of Lake Grant. They had before them\
  \ some days\u2019 respite. The plateau of Prospect Heights, Granite House, and the\
  \ dockyard were for the moment preserved. And these few days it was necessary to\
  \ employ in planking and carefully calking the vessel, and launching her. The colonists\
  \ would then take refuge on board the vessel, content to rig her after she should\
  \ be afloat on the waters. With the danger of an explosion which threatened to destroy\
  \ the island there could be no security on shore. The walls of Granite House, once\
  \ so sure a retreat, might at any moment fall in upon them.</p>"
- "<p>During the six following days, from the 25th to the 30th of January, the colonists\
  \ accomplished as much of the construction of their vessel as twenty men could have\
  \ done. They hardly allowed themselves a moment\u2019s repose, and the glare of\
  \ the flames which shot from the crater enabled them to work night and day. The\
  \ flow of lava continued, but perhaps less abundantly. This was fortunate, for Lake\
  \ Grant was almost entirely choked up, and if more lava should accumulate it would\
  \ inevitably spread over the plateau of Prospect Heights, and thence upon the beach.</p>"
- <p>But if the island was thus partially protected on this side, it was not so with
  the western part.</p>
- <p>In fact, the second stream of lava, which had followed the valley of Falls River,
  a valley of great extent, the land on both sides of the creek being flat, met with
  no obstacle. The burning liquid had then spread through the forest of the Far West.
  At this period of the year, when the trees were dried up by a tropical heat, the
  forest caught fire instantaneously, in such a manner that the conflagration extended
  itself both by the trunks of the trees and by their higher branches, whose interlacement
  favored its progress. It even appeared that the current of flame spread more rapidly
  among the summits of the trees than the current of lava at their bases.</p>
- <p>Thus it happened that the wild animals, jaguars, wild boars, capybaras, koalas,
  and game of every kind, mad with terror, had fled to the banks of the Mercy and
  to the Tadorn Marsh, beyond the road to Port Balloon. But the colonists were too
  much occupied with their task to pay any attention to even the most formidable of
  these animals. They had abandoned Granite House, and would not even take shelter
  at the Chimneys, but encamped under a tent, near the mouth of the Mercy.</p>
- <p>Each day Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights.
  Sometimes Herbert accompanied them, but never Pencroft, who could not bear to look
  upon the prospect of the island now so utterly devastated.</p>
- "<p>It was, in truth, a heart\u2011rending spectacle. All the wooded part of the\
  \ island was now completely bare. One single clump of green trees raised their heads\
  \ at the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula. Here and there were a few grotesque\
  \ blackened and branchless stumps. The side of the devastated forest was even more\
  \ barren than Tadorn Marsh. The eruption of lava had been complete. Where formerly\
  \ sprang up that charming verdure, the soil was now nothing but a savage mass of\
  \ volcanic tufa. In the valleys of the Falls and Mercy rivers no drop of water now\
  \ flowed towards the sea, and should Lake Grant be entirely dried up, the colonists\
  \ would have no means of quenching their thirst. But, fortunately the lava had spared\
  \ the southern corner of the lake, containing all that remained of the drinking\
  \ water of the island. Towards the northwest stood out the rugged and well\u2011\
  defined outlines of the sides of the volcano, like a gigantic claw hovering over\
  \ the island. What a sad and fearful sight, and how painful to the colonists, who,\
  \ from a fertile domain covered with forests, irrigated by watercourses, and enriched\
  \ by the produce of their toils, found themselves, as it were, transported to a\
  \ desolate rock, upon which, but for their reserves of provisions, they could not\
  \ even gather the means of subsistence!</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is enough to break one\u2019s heart!\u201D said Gideon Spilett, one\
  \ day.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CYes, Spilett,\u201D answered the engineer. \u201CMay God grant us the\
  \ time to complete this vessel, now our sole refuge!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDo not you think, Cyrus, that the violence of the eruption has somewhat\
  \ lessened? The volcano still vomits forth lava, but somewhat less abundantly, if\
  \ I mistake not.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt matters little,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding. \u201CThe fire is still\
  \ burning in the interior of the mountain, and the sea may break in at any moment.\
  \ We are in the condition of passengers whose ship is devoured by a conflagration\
  \ which they cannot extinguish, and who know that sooner or later the flames must\
  \ reach the powder\u2011magazine. To work, Spilett, to work, and let us not lose\
  \ an hour!\u201D</p>"
- <p>During eight days more, that is to say until the 7th of February, the lava continued
  to flow, but the eruption was confined within the previous limits. Cyrus Harding
  feared above all lest the liquefied matter should overflow the shore, for in that
  event the dockyard could not escape. Moreover, about this time the colonists felt
  in the frame of the island vibrations which alarmed them to the highest degree.</p>
- <p>It was the 20th of February. Yet another month must elapse before the vessel
  would be ready for sea. Would the island hold together till then? The intention
  of Pencroft and Cyrus Harding was to launch the vessel as soon as the hull should
  be complete. The deck, the upperworks, the interior woodwork and the rigging might
  be finished afterwards, but the essential point was that the colonists should have
  an assured refuge away from the island. Perhaps it might be even better to conduct
  the vessel to Port Balloon, that is to say, as far as possible from the center of
  eruption, for at the mouth of the Mercy, between the islet and the wall of granite,
  it would run the risk of being crushed in the event of any convulsion. All the exertions
  of the voyagers were therefore concentrated upon the completion of the hull.</p>
- <p>Thus the 3rd of March arrived, and they might calculate upon launching the vessel
  in ten days.</p>
- <p>Hope revived in the hearts of the colonists, who had, in this fourth year of
  their sojourn on Lincoln island, suffered so many trials. Even Pencroft lost in
  some measure the somber taciturnity occasioned by the devastation and ruin of his
  domain. His hopes, it is true, were concentrated upon his vessel.</p>
- "<p>\u201CWe shall finish it,\u201D he said to the engineer, \u201Cwe shall finish\
  \ it, captain, and it is time, for the season is advancing and the equinox will\
  \ soon be here. Well, if necessary, we must put in to Tabor island to spend the\
  \ winter. But think of Tabor island after Lincoln Island. Ah, how unfortunate! Who\
  \ could have believed it possible?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CLet us get on,\u201D was the engineer\u2019s invariable reply.</p>"
- <p>And they worked away without losing a moment.</p>
- "<p>\u201CMaster,\u201D asked Neb, a few days later, \u201Cdo you think all this\
  \ could have happened if Captain Nemo had been still alive?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCertainly, Neb,\u201D answered Cyrus Harding.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI, for one, don\u2019t believe it!\u201D whispered Pencroft to Neb.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CNor I!\u201D answered Neb seriously.</p>"
- "<p>During the first week of March appearances again became menacing. Thousands\
  \ of threads like glass, formed of fluid lava, fell like rain upon the island. The\
  \ crater was again boiling with lava which overflowed the back of the volcano. The\
  \ torrent flowed along the surface of the hardened tufa, and destroyed the few meager\
  \ skeletons of trees which had withstood the first eruption. The stream, flowing\
  \ this time towards the southwest shore of Lake Grant, stretched beyond Creek Glycerine,\
  \ and invaded the plateau of Prospect Heights. This last blow to the work of the\
  \ colonists was terrible. The mill, the buildings of the inner court, the stables,\
  \ were all destroyed. The affrighted poultry fled in all directions. Top and Jup\
  \ showed signs of the greatest alarm, as if their instinct warned them of an impending\
  \ catastrophe. A large number of the animals of the island had perished in the first\
  \ eruption. Those which survived found no refuge but Tadorn Marsh, save a few to\
  \ which the plateau of Prospect Heights afforded asylum. But even this last retreat\
  \ was now closed to them, and the lava\u2011torrent, flowing over the edge of the\
  \ granite wall, began to pour down upon the beach its cataracts of fire. The sublime\
  \ horror of this spectacle passed all description. During the night it could only\
  \ be compared to a Niagara of molten fluid, with its incandescent vapors above and\
  \ its boiling masses below.</p>"
- <p>The colonists were driven to their last entrenchment, and although the upper
  seams of the vessel were not yet calked, they decided to launch her at once.</p>
- <p>Pencroft and Ayrton therefore set about the necessary preparations for the launching,
  which was to take place the morning of the next day, the 9th of March.</p>
- <p>But during the night of the 8th an enormous column of vapor escaping from the
  crater rose with frightful explosions to a height of more than three thousand feet.
  The wall of Dakkar Grotto had evidently given way under the pressure of gases, and
  the sea, rushing through the central shaft into the igneous gulf, was at once converted
  into vapor. But the crater could not afford a sufficient outlet for this vapor.
  An explosion, which might have been heard at a distance of a hundred miles, shook
  the air. Fragments of mountains fell into the Pacific, and, in a few minutes, the
  ocean rolled over the spot where Lincoln island once stood.</p>
- <p>Chapter 20</p>
- "<p>An isolated rock, thirty feet in length, twenty in breadth, scarcely ten from\
  \ the water\u2019s edge, such was the only solid point which the waves of the Pacific\
  \ had not engulfed.</p>"
- <p>It was all that remained of the structure of Granite House! The wall had fallen
  headlong and been then shattered to fragments, and a few of the rocks of the large
  room were piled one above another to form this point. All around had disappeared
  in the abyss; the inferior cone of Mount Franklin, rent asunder by the explosion;
  the lava jaws of Shark Gulf, the plateau of Prospect Heights, Safety Islet, the
  granite rocks of Port Balloon, the basalts of Dakkar Grotto, the long Serpentine
  Peninsula, so distant nevertheless from the center of the eruption. All that could
  now be seen of Lincoln Island was the narrow rock which now served as a refuge to
  the six colonists and their dog Top.</p>
- <p>The animals had also perished in the catastrophe; the birds, as well as those
  representing the fauna of the island?all either crushed or drowned, and the unfortunate
  Jup himself had, alas! found his death in some crevice of the soil.</p>
- <p>If Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton had survived,
  it was because, assembled under their tent, they had been hurled into the sea at
  the instant when the fragments of the island rained down on every side.</p>
- "<p>When they reached the surface they could only perceive, at half a cable\u2019\
  s length, this mass of rocks, towards which they swam and on which they found footing.</p>"
- <p>On this barren rock they had now existed for nine days. A few provisions taken
  from the magazine of Granite House before the catastrophe, a little fresh water
  from the rain which had fallen in a hollow of the rock, was all that the unfortunate
  colonists possessed. Their last hope, the vessel, had been shattered to pieces.
  They had no means of quitting the reef; no fire, nor any means of obtaining it.
  It seemed that they must inevitably perish.</p>
- <p>This day, the 18th of March, there remained only provisions for two days, although
  they limited their consumption to the bare necessaries of life. All their science
  and intelligence could avail them nothing in their present position. They were in
  the hand of God.</p>
- "<p>Cyrus Harding was calm, Gideon Spilett more nervous, and Pencroft, a prey to\
  \ sullen anger, walked to and fro on the rock. Herbert did not for a moment quit\
  \ the engineer\u2019s side, as if demanding from him that assistance he had no power\
  \ to give. Neb and Ayrton were resigned to their fate.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh, what a misfortune! what a misfortune!\u201D often repeated Pencroft.\
  \ \u201CIf we had but a walnut\u2011shell to take us to Tabor Island! But we have\
  \ nothing, nothing!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Nemo did right to die,\u201D said Neb.</p>"
- <p>During the five ensuing days Cyrus Harding and his unfortunate companions husbanded
  their provisions with the most extreme care, eating only what would prevent them
  from dying of starvation. Their weakness was extreme. Herbert and Neb began to show
  symptoms of delirium.</p>
- "<p>Under these circumstances was it possible for them to retain even the shadow\
  \ of a hope? No! What was their sole remaining chance? That a vessel should appear\
  \ in sight of the rock? But they knew only too well from experience that no ships\
  \ ever visited this part of the Pacific. Could they calculate that, by a truly providential\
  \ coincidence, the Scotch yacht would arrive precisely at this time in search of\
  \ Ayrton at Tabor Island? It was scarcely probable; and, besides, supposing she\
  \ should come there, as the colonists had not been able to deposit a notice pointing\
  \ out Ayrton\u2019s change of abode, the commander of the yacht, after having explored\
  \ Tabor Island without results, would again set sail and return to lower latitudes.</p>"
- <p>No! no hope of being saved could be retained, and a horrible death, death from
  hunger and thirst, awaited them upon this rock.</p>
- <p>Already they were stretched on the rock, inanimate, and no longer conscious of
  what passed around them. Ayrton alone, by a supreme effort, from time to time raised
  his head, and cast a despairing glance over the desert ocean.</p>
- "<p>But on the morning of the 24th of March Ayrton\u2019s arms were extended toward\
  \ a point in the horizon; he raised himself, at first on his knees, then upright,\
  \ and his hand seemed to make a signal.</p>"
- <p>A sail was in sight off the rock. She was evidently not without an object. The
  reef was the mark for which she was making in a direct line, under all steam, and
  the unfortunate colonists might have made her out some hours before if they had
  had the strength to watch the horizon.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe ?Duncan\u2019!\u201D murmured Ayrton?and fell back without sign of\
  \ life.</p>"
- <p>When Cyrus Harding and his companions recovered consciousness, thanks to the
  attention lavished upon them, they found themselves in the cabin of a steamer, without
  being able to comprehend how they had escaped death.</p>
- <p>A word from Ayrton explained everything.</p>
- "<p>\u201CThe ?Duncan\u2019!\u201D he murmured.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CThe ?Duncan\u2019!\u201D exclaimed Cyrus Harding. And raising his hand\
  \ to Heaven, he said, \u201COh! Almighty God! mercifully hast Thou preserved us!\u201D\
  </p>"
- "<p>It was, in fact, the \u201CDuncan,\u201D Lord Glenarvan\u2019s yacht, now commanded\
  \ by Robert, son of Captain Grant, who had been despatched to Tabor Island to find\
  \ Ayrton, and bring him back to his native land after twelve years of expiation.</p>"
- <p>The colonists were not only saved, but already on the way to their native country.</p>
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Grant,\u201D asked Cyrus Harding, \u201Cwho can have suggested\
  \ to you the idea, after having left Tabor Island, where you did not find Ayrton,\
  \ of coming a hundred miles farther northeast?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CCaptain Harding,\u201D replied Robert Grant, \u201Cit was in order to\
  \ find, not only Ayrton, but yourself and your companions.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy companions and myself?\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CDoubtless, at Lincoln Island.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAt Lincoln Island!\u201D exclaimed in a breath Gideon Spilett, Herbert,\
  \ Neb, and Pencroft, in the highest degree astonished.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CHow could you be aware of the existence of Lincoln Island?\u201D inquired\
  \ Cyrus Harding, \u201Cit is not even named in the charts.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI knew of it from a document left by you on Tabor Island,\u201D answered\
  \ Robert Grant.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CA document!\u201D cried Gideon Spilett.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CWithout doubt, and here it is,\u201D answered Robert Grant, producing\
  \ a paper which indicated the longitude and latitude of Lincoln Island, \u201Cthe\
  \ present residence of Ayrton and five American colonists.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIt is Captain Nemo!\u201D cried Cyrus Harding, after having read the notice,\
  \ and recognized that the handwriting was similar to that of the paper found at\
  \ the corral.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CAh!\u201D said Pencroft, \u201Cit was then he who took our ?Bonadventure\u2019\
  \ and hazarded himself alone to go to Tabor Island!\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CIn order to leave this notice,\u201D added Herbert.</p>"
- "<p>\u201CI was then right in saying,\u201D exclaimed the sailor, \u201Cthat even\
  \ after his death the captain would render us a last service.\u201D</p>"
- "<p>\u201CMy friends,\u201D said Cyrus Harding, in a voice of the profoundest emotion,\
  \ \u201Cmay the God of mercy have had pity on the soul of Captain Nemo, our benefactor.\u201D\
  </p>"
- <p>The colonists uncovered themselves at these last words of Cyrus Harding, and
  murmured the name of Captain Nemo.</p>
- "<p>Then Ayrton, approaching the engineer, said simply, \u201CWhere should this\
  \ coffer be deposited?\u201D</p>"
- <p>It was the coffer which Ayrton had saved at the risk of his life, at the very
  instant that the island had been engulfed, and which he now faithfully handed to
  the engineer.</p>
- "<p>\u201CAyrton! Ayrton!\u201D said Cyrus Harding, deeply touched. Then, addressing\
  \ Robert Grant, \u201CSir,\u201D he added, \u201Cyou left behind you a criminal;\
  \ you find in his place a man who has become honest by penitence, and whose hand\
  \ I am proud to clasp in mine.\u201D</p>"
- <p>Robert Grant was now made acquainted with the strange history of Captain Nemo
  and the colonists of Lincoln Island. Then, observation being taken of what remained
  of this shoal, which must henceforward figure on the charts of the Pacific, the
  order was given to make all sail.</p>
- <p>A few weeks afterwards the colonists landed in America, and found their country
  once more at peace after the terrible conflict in which right and justice had triumphed.</p>
- "<p>Of the treasures contained in the coffer left by Captain Nemo to the colonists\
  \ of Lincoln Island, the larger portion was employed in the purchase of a vast territory\
  \ in the State of Iowa. One pearl alone, the finest, was reserved from the treasure\
  \ and sent to Lady Glenarvan in the name of the castaways restored to their country\
  \ by the \u201CDuncan.\u201D</p>"
- <p>There, upon this domain, the colonists invited to labor, that is to say, to wealth
  and happiness, all those to whom they had hoped to offer the hospitality of Lincoln
  Island. There was founded a vast colony to which they gave the name of that island
  sunk beneath the waters of the Pacific. A river there was called the Mercy, a mountain
  took the name of Mount Franklin, a small lake was named Lake Grant, and the forests
  became the forests of the Far West. It might have been an island on terra firma.</p>
- "<p>There, under the intelligent hands of the engineer and his companions, everything\
  \ prospered. Not one of the former colonists of Lincoln Island was absent, for they\
  \ had sworn to live always together. Neb was with his master; Ayrton was there ready\
  \ to sacrifice himself for all; Pencroft was more a farmer than he had ever been\
  \ a sailor; Herbert, who completed his studies under the superintendence of Cyrus\
  \ Harding, and Gideon Spilett, who founded the New Lincoln Herald, the best\u2011\
  informed journal in the world.</p>"
- <p>There Cyrus Harding and his companions received at intervals visits from Lord
  and Lady Glenarvan, Captain John Mangles and his wife, the sister of Robert Grant,
  Robert Grant himself, Major McNab, and all those who had taken part in the history
  both of Captain Grant and Captain Nemo.</p>
- <p>There, to conclude, all were happy, united in the present as they had been in
  the past; but never could they forget that island upon which they had arrived poor
  and friendless, that island which, during four years had supplied all their wants,
  and of which there remained but a fragment of granite washed by the waves of the
  Pacific, the tomb of him who had borne the name of Captain Nemo.</p>

- <p>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg</p>
- <p>Literary Archive Foundation</p>
- "<p>Project Gutenberg\u2011tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide</p>"
- <p>spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of</p>
- <p>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be</p>
- <p>freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest</p>
- <p>array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations</p>
- <p>($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt</p>
- <p>status with the IRS.</p>
- <p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating</p>
- <p>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United</p>
- <p>States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a</p>
- <p>considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up</p>
- <p>with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations</p>
- <p>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To</p>
- <p>SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any</p>
- <p>particular state visit http://pglaf.org</p>
- <p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we</p>
- <p>have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition</p>
- <p>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who</p>
- <p>approach us with offers to donate.</p>
- <p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make</p>
- <p>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from</p>
- <p>outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
- <p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation</p>
- <p>methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other</p>
- <p>ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.</p>

- "<p>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u2011tm</p>"
- <p>concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared</p>
- <p>with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project</p>

- "<p>Project Gutenberg\u2011tm eBooks are often created from several printed</p>"
- <p>editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.</p>
- <p>unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily</p>
- <p>keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>
- <p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>
- <p>     http://www.gutenberg.org</p>
- "<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg\u2011tm,</p>"
- <p>including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary</p>
- <p>Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to</p>
